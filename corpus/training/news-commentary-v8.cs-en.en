SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Lately, with gold prices up more than 300% over the last decade, it is harder than ever.
Just last December, fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment, sensibly pointing out gold’s risks.
Wouldn’t you know it?
Since their articles appeared, the price of gold has moved up still further. Gold prices even hit a record-high $1,300 recently.
Last December, many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $2,000.
Now, emboldened by continuing appreciation, some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that.
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980’s.
Since then, the index has climbed above 10,000.
Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can’t it increase ten-fold, too?
Admittedly, getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems.
After adjusting for inflation, today’s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980.
Back then, gold hit $850, or well over $2,000 in today’s dollars.
But January 1980 was arguably a “freak peak” during a period of heightened geo-political instability.
At $1,300, today’s price is probably more than double very long-term, inflation-adjusted, average gold prices.
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here?
One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar.
With soaring deficits, and a rudderless fiscal policy, one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press.
And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge.
Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold. But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.
In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt, precisely so that its value might be inflated away.
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it can happen anywhere.
Even so, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable, so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations.
Some have argued instead that gold’s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold.
There is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument.
After all, medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold.
Wouldn’t it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more?
In my view, the most powerful argument to justify today’s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities.
At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks.
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar, gold’s appeal has naturally grown.
So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today’s higher gold price, although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future.
Indeed, another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization.
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements.
After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store.
Today, with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds.
But if real interest rates rise significantly, as well they might someday, gold prices could plummet.
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term, with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance.
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.
Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
But, despite gold’s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price, it remains a very risky bet for most of us.
Of course, such considerations might have little influence on prices.
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.
Last week Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin.
They departed pledging to revive Europe's growth.
We've heard that empty promise before.
Instead, the European Union needs a new direction.
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain's engagement with Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960's.
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986.
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union.
But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states.
Faced with a new EU initiative, our traditional response has often been to oppose it, vote against it, lose the vote, then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else.
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes.
So am I.
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept.
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market; free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy, far less a common taxation policy.
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness.
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours.
Which areas should be applied to every member state, and which should be optional?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states.
In areas which serve their national interest, individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co‑operate with others.
The Union's members should form a series of overlapping circles: different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing.
Precedents exist for this.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO's central command.
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro, the Schengen Agreement, and the Social Chapter.
These precedents can be extended.
So far, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating specific opt‑outs.
But since 1998, there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co‑operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member.
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt‑out of a new initiative, those that support it can simply opt‑in.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them.
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe.
That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey.
I don't want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to.
But I don't want to block their way.
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely.
But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken.
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out.
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro, or hope for its failure.
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively.
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework.
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution.
We disagree with many of its contents, of course, but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all.
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty, and a single entity, whether you call it a state or not, with its own legal personality, deriving its authority from its own constitution.
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form, the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system.
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra‑national constitution.
That is a radical change, not the mere tidying‑up exercise some suggest.
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties.
They safeguard them, and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state.
BRUSSELS – Austerity alone cannot solve Europe's economic and financial crisis.
Growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal.
European Union leaders now recognize this: kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council’s meeting on January 30.
But the big question remains: How?
The need for immediate action is clear.
The eurozone’s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011; even Germany’s shrank.
The new year is looking grim.
France is flat-lining (as is Britain).
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession.
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump.
And eurozone unemployment is at record highs, with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece.
The economic headwinds are formidable: fiscal austerity, high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries, credit cutting by banks, deleveraging households, weak private-sector investment, and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand.
Until growth resumes, any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile.
Recession will hit banks’ and governments’ already-weak balance sheets, increasing pressure for faster deleveraging.
But, while gradual adjustment is essential, faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating: big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral.
A big new push for growth is therefore vital.
So far, the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms, which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility.
The crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately (one exception is permitting shops to open longer).
On the contrary, a shakeout of less productive jobs, for example, would at first raise unemployment, increase government outlays, and reduce private spending.
And, because demand is depressed, credit is in short supply, and barriers to enterprise are often high, it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs.
In short, structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012.
Instead, the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as France, Italy, and Spain (and the United Kingdom) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks; now it needs to support the real economy, too.
While official interest rates are only 1%, solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5% to borrow for ten years, while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates, if at all.
So the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9% ratio; and, where necessary, national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses.
While improving access to finance is vital, governments also need to do more to boost investment.
They should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business, lift barriers to venture capital, and introduce temporary 100% capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment.
At the EU level, the (callable) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased, as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September, so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment, notably in infrastructure.
Boosting exports is also essential.
Deficit countries need to become more competitive, increasing productivity while cutting costs.
A more competitive currency would be welcome: just as the sterling’s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports, a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports.
A fiscal devaluation – slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT – would also help.
Surplus countries, too, must do their part, which is in their own interest.
Just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise, so Germany – whose current-account surplus exceeds China's both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms – needs a higher real exchange rate.
That means that Germans need to earn higher wages, commensurate with their increased productivity, so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays.
If businesses will not oblige, an income-tax cut would do the trick.
That brings us to fiscal policy.
Governments that cannot borrow cheaply (or at all) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts.
But they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity.
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure, while cutting subsidies and transfer payments.
They should also legislate now for future reforms, notably to encourage people to work longer.
Last but not least, governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0% in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand.
Would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year?
At the onset of the US-led war in Iraq, two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome.
The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally.
Derided by detractors as a new "domino theory," this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America's role in post-WWII Japan.
Against the optimism of that "Japan scenario," pessimists argued that a "Somalia scenario" was more likely.
They staked their claim on the tribal, sectarian, and multiethnic nature of Iraq, which, in the absence of dictatorship, would supposedly incite Iraq's collapse into a "failed state," with rampant warlordism, ethnic and religious feuds, and harboring of terrorist organizations.
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios, increasingly resembling Afghanistan.
This "Afghan scenario" implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government.
Bad as it sounds, this prospect appears to be a "realistic" compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing, unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state.
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions, seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced.
Indeed, such hopes were misplaced.
Iraq's political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy: notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking, the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted, and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community.
On the other hand, much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the "traditional" nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy.
For these analyses are hardly neutral, but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation.
In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds, a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms: grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding (nationalism, socialism, Islamism), versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience.
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual, cultural identity, civil society, and the nation-state.
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated.
But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it.
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system, but they are not its sole components.
Indeed, the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of "democracy" and "human rights" as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle.
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context.
Advocates of the notion of "Arab exceptionalism," which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with "grand narrative" ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world's patronage-based political order.
The models used in the West, both in political circles and in academia, for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient.
In particular, many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model, reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented "reality" of separate communities.
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its "genuine" original components: Sunni, Shi`i, and Kurd.
In fact, Iraqi society is more complex than this.
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging, but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical, cultural, religious, and political identities of Iraqi individuals.
Given the right circumstances, it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be.
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances.
Indeed, the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam's dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society.
Upon Saddam's fall, a large "middle ground" existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice.
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground, opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba`athism.
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground.
As a result, the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded.
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy.
The CPA, and the world community, must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society.
Even if such efforts succeed, the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive.
But instead of succumbing to a "Somalia scenario," dreaming of a "Japan scenario," or settling for an "Afghanistan scenario," Iraq may yet become a "scenario" for successful intervention in the 21 st century.
Although the EU's eastward enlargement has not yet happened, the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow: when should the new, predominantly postcommunist, members adopt the euro?
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty's provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry. 
At the outset, it must be stressed that, in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed.
Early entry, otherwise, would be an empty gesture. 
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible, but preferable to delay.
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004, new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006. 
Is this realistic?
Well, most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU.
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets.
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece, Portugal, and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU. 
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive.
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5% - not much higher than in many EU countries, and lower than in The Netherlands last year.
As with structural convergence, EU candidates already outperform Spain, Portugal, and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut.
Nor is there much risk of large, future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized. 
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows.
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called "Balassa-Samuelson" effect: rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates' tradable sectors - export manufacturing, for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies, including in non-tradable sectors like services.
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average. 
The Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates, its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2%.
With the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation, the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5% of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach. 
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership?
From the standpoint of current member states, would admitting Hungary, Latvia, Poland, or Slovakia, sooner rather than later, drag down the euro as many fear? 
Fears that extending EMU to new states "too soon" would undermine the euro's external exchange rate are irrational.
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time, they will together account for a mere 6% of its total GDP.
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error. 
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information.
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise.
Equally, the transition period is already turbulent, with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Indeed, capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15% fluctuation band either side of a central parity. 
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves.
The benefit is simple: ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility, as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro.
This would help keep the candidates' economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels. 
This is an exceptionally weak argument, and a politically suspect one, too.
As European Central Bank data shows, average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44% of the eurozone level.
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry, probably lasting several decades.
More important, long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed (EMU) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms. 
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms.
In almost all candidates, further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation, more flexible labor markets, and completion of privatization.
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms. 
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear.
Early adoption, by contrast, would be more conducive to these reforms, and thus to real convergence.
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency, reduced transaction costs, and a solid macroeconomic framework.
This strategy, not one of deferred entry, promises the most for both the EU's current and its future members. 
PARIS – As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening.
At the start of the crisis, many people likened it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns.
Today, the mood is much grimmer, with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional.
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms.
For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989.
Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Indeed, on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.
Yet 2008-2009, like 1989, may very well correspond to an epochal change, whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades.
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc.
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.
Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now.
First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.
Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish winners from losers.
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass.
In better shape, but not alone.
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes.
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard, Asians – Chinese and Indians, in particular – are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much, and whom they would overcome in the coming decades.
But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos.
What, for example, will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “European dream” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe’s supposedly open countries?
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers, including me, would have assumed.
We can only hope that, in the end, the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be.
MOSCOW – Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert, someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups.
In fact, my formal residence is in New York City, but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia, training to be a cosmonaut in Star City, just outside Moscow. 
It all came about in a number of ways.
First of all, as a kid, I just assumed that I would go to the moon, without having to do much in particular to make it happen.
I just took it for granted that, by the time I was, say, 40, space travel would be a common thing.
My father was involved with the United States space program, and we had some moon rocks at home, so I thought it was no big deal.
Then I got distracted for about 40 years.
A few years ago, however, I started paying attention to space again.
A lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same: Elon Musk, a co-founder of PayPal, founded Space-X; Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin; Jeff Greason, a senior manager at Intel, started XCOR Aerospace (in which I’m an investor).
In 2005, the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs, I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation.
Meanwhile, in about 2005, I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy.
One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (sold to VeriSign), who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “space tourist.”
One evening, the group sat around a campfire as the sun set, and around 50 African schoolchildren were bussed in.
Altogether, there were about 100 of us, President Mbeki included, around a roaring fire.
Once it was dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space.
He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures, complete with clips of him floating around, catching bubbles in his mouth, and so on.
The kids loved it, and I'm sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science.
Eventually, I invested in Space Adventures, the company that organized Shuttleworth’s trip into space.
Later, I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi, the fifth (and soon seventh) space tourist, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.
(Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program, and now has another start-up, Intentional Software, and a foundation, as well as a Web site, CharlesinSpace.org.)
Soon after, I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team.
Yes, I would love to actually go, but the trip to space costs $35 to $40 million, whereas backup training costs “only” $3 million.
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is (very) tentatively slated to go.
Space Adventures was pushing for 2009, but I was pretty busy.
Then something happened last spring: my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy.
(She is doing well now and, in fact, just won a mini-marathon.)
A couple of weeks later, I was faced with one of those conflicts: a board meeting here, a conference there, another opportunity at the same time somewhere else. “Aaagh,” I thought, “if only I had a double mastectomy: I could cancel all these things and no one would complain!”

Good grief!  I realized my priorities were all out of whack.   So in some odd way, this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy – a positive one, to be sure, but the same kind of reset-button experience. 
It is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through 23andMe (www.23andme.com) and the Personal Genome Project (www.personalgenome.org): If you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer’s in a few years, what would you do?
Why, I’d go train to be a cosmonaut, of course! And why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer’s?  Next month, I will write about what training to go into space actually involves.
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date.
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, a new era perhaps, but in any case a time of change.
The terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered; but it is “9/11” that has become the catchphrase, almost like “August 1914.”
But was it really a war that started on September 11, 2001?
Not all are happy about this American notion.
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged. “War” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement.
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.
By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”
Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations, the Patriot Act’s overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty, such as habeas corpus , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom.
From an early date, the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of: the arrest without trial of “illegal combatants” who are deprived of all human rights.
The world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places.
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights. Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few.
A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims.
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.
On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble.
In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.
In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.
The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific.
In most countries of continental Europe, “9/11” has remained an American date.
There is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “war against terrorism” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.
This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.
People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling.
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.
Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems.
While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.
One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators’ resentment of the West and its ways.
But the West’s key features, democracy and the rule of law, have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers.
Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.
First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary.
Some of today’s restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly.
Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety.
The terrorists with whom we are currently at “war” cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy.
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.
NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission.
In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.
September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace.
On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.
Despite the attention devoted to the “Global War on Terrorism,” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies, globalization, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political upheavals in the Middle East. 
As for the future, it is much more likely to be defined by the United States’ need to put its economic house in order; China’s trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world’s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges.
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.
They can destroy but not create.
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.
Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.
Intelligence assets have been redirected.
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.
International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area.
Military force has played a role as well.
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.
But progress is not to be confused with victory.
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.
Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.
A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago.
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.
The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: “Are we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?”
All things being equal, we probably are. But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.
What is to be done?
Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India.
Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.
Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.
But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this.
Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police.
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty, due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies, but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality.
The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
New research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons.
First, we now know that adaptation will be essential, because temperatures will rise by another 0.6°C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
We also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe.
In some areas, modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and/or irrigation remains viable.
Even with 0.6°C warming, however, Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and, eventually, increased vulnerability to infectious disease.
These impacts will clearly hit the planet’s worst-off inhabitants hardest: the “bottom billion” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition.&#160;
Ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge.
Long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens’ health, but in the meantime the planet’s poorest people will need help from the rich.
Our analysis investigated, for example, the merits of more targeted policies for the near term: purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change.
The goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming.
Benefits would appear almost immediately, but would dissipate over time as economies developed.
Even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world, thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere.
But we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test.
We allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $18 billion.
The discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $800 billion, but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $685 billion.
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
We allocated $50 billion to research into greener technology, so that only $750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation.
The gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell, and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective.
As a result, the research and development program essentially paid for itself, and total discounted benefits for the $800 billion investment climbed to more than $2.1 trillion.&#160;
Ensuring that research and development is part of the world’s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “come onboard.”
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would, for example, increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three.
Expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages, even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities, which would push in the opposite direction.
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment, even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to “solve” the problem.
To make a real difference, especially in the near term, the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology, which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives.
STOCKHOLM – One year after the war in Georgia of last August, pushing the “reset” button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays.
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to “reset” strained United States-Russian ties.
The European Union, though not in need of a “reset” because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors, is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations.
When the EU launched its new “Eastern Partnership” in May, the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union’s six immediate eastern neighbors – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU’s eastern neighborhood an urgent need.
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU.
The Eastern Partnership – originating from a Polish/Swedish initiative – offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas.
In trade and economic relations, it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries.
It confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal (with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime), promises enhanced cooperation on energy security, diversification, and efficiency, and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas.
Sweden’s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts.
However, it comes at a time when the Union’s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges, with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard.
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade, severely undermining its steel industry.
Georgia’s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment, for which there is hardly any appetite today.
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market, such as Moldova, have seen the crisis arrive more slowly, but the real effect might be equally as bad, and they are likely to recover more slowly.
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis.
But it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis: imperfect market economies, weak state institutions, and continued corruption.
The Eastern Partnership’s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power.
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political.
In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country’s stability.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
Political association with the EU, and the process of integration under this Partnership, will promote reforms in these key areas.
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work – the nuts and bolts – of the Partnership.
The establishment of “Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs,” designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country, should take place before the year’s end.
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well, and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed.
Here, Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs, which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs, but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
The Swedish Presidency, together with the European Commission, intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn.
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation, as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries.
At the end of the year, a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead.
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration, about the six countries moving closer to the EU’s values, legislation, and ways of working, and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence.
In Russia, there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it.
But this, of course, is untrue.
On the contrary, Russia, like Turkey, will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership’s multilateral dimensions.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing.
Nevertheless, it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region.
PARIS – “Let’s engage Russia if we can, but contain it if we must.” These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990’s.
Since then, Russia may have changed dramatically, but not our questions about it.
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture, which is European, and its political system, which is becoming increasingly “Asian,” at least in the bad old sense of “Oriental despotism”?
Should the best answer to the return of Russia’s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world’s new maverick?
Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference, aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe, necessary?
Could the answer be a bit of both?
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon, or reverting to Soviet form – shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest – what is needed is not the “league of democracies” advocated by some conservatives in America.
What is needed, instead, is a “stability league” that includes prominent actors like China, India, and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “rocking the boat” of the international system.
Such a strategy implies, first of all, a solid partnership with China, not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy, but because it is a status-quo power.
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran, and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO.
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear. “Do not fool yourself.
Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment.
Europe may be weak and divided, America may no longer be what it was, but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas, you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers.
China is; you are not.”
But the containment argument fails, because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner.
More importantly, rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia’s great power pretensions too seriously.
For example, many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe, but no longer for the world.
At the Cold War’s end, Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union.
Today, the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia.
The other alternative to a rebirth of “containment” would consist in accepting the Russian argument, or more precisely, Russian “emotions.”
It would mean saying, in effect, “We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years.
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo, we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests.
Let’s sit down together like Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe.
What do you want back?
What do we keep?”
This approach might recognize Russia’s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus.
Indeed, while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy’s France, which currently holds the EU presidency, Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia’s dismemberment.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president’s irresponsible behavior.
As for Ukraine, it may one day become part of the European Union, but its future is not in NATO.
Yet, between all-out containment, which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic, and accommodation which borders on appeasement, which would be dangerous for Europe’s future, a third way, based on a few firm principles, must be found.
These principles are clear.
First, Ukraine’s territorial integrity is not negotiable.
This has been said many times, but repetition does not diminish its importance.
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
Second, even if the West condemns Georgia’s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia’s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories, the Kremlin’s shameless brutality is unacceptable.
After all, this is Europe more than six decades after World War II, and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation’s will upon another cannot be accepted passively.
In the short term, time may be on Russia’s side.
In the long run – economically, demographically, politically, strategically – time is on “our” side, if we stick to our values and our principles.
The drubbing that many governments suffered in the recent elections to the European Union Parliament places them in a difficult position as they maneuver ahead of this week's EU Summit.
Only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them.
The summit has two purposes: to finalize the text of a new EU Constitution, and to appoint the next President of the Commission.
These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
The problem for Europe's leaders is that their own repudiation by voters does not necessarily carry the same message as the rise of the Euroskeptic parties.
The record slump in the vote for Gerhard Schröder's governing Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his policy towards Europe, but a great deal to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies - and the persistence of low growth and high unemployment - at home.
Despite nationalist parties' success in France, the same is true of the setback for President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party.
In Britain, by contrast, where the economy is strong and unemployment low, the main factor behind the collapse in the vote for the governing Labor Party has been anger with Tony Blair's determination to go to war in Iraq beside George Bush.
Nevertheless, the rise of Euroskeptic parties, in a number of countries including Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, and the Czech Republic, has worrying implications for a summit meeting whose purpose is to take European integration a small but unmistakable step forward.
In Britain, in particular, the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) can only strengthen the government's long-standing latent Euroskepticism.
The proposed constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is intended to enhance the political and moral legitimacy of the EU.
But will it really enhance the rights of EU citizens?
Or, as the British government insists, will it merely be a declaratory document that only describes rights already existing under national legislation in the member states.
The draft constitution would enhance the policymaking powers of the Union, with a bit more majority voting in the Council of Ministers, and a stronger role for the European Parliament.
But, despite Tony Blair's one-time declaration that he would take Britain "into the heart of Europe," he remains viscerally opposed to the prospect of further integration, and he will resist any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his "red line" areas of tax, foreign policy, and EU budget finance.
Blair's Euroskepticism is understandable insofar as it chimes with the British mood.
Opinion polls consistently show that British voters are unenthusiastic about the EU, and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer poll, conducted throughout the Union for the Commission - but before the recent enlargement from 15 to 25 member states.
One question always asked in this poll is whether voters tend to trust or mistrust different institutions, such as national parliaments, national governments, and the European Union.
Overall, the general level of trust in the European Union is not high: only 41% of voters tend to trust the EU, whereas 42% tend not to trust it.
But in Britain, the figures are dramatically different: only 19% trust the EU, while 55% distrust it.
By contrast, the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole: the average EU-wide level of trust in the European Parliament is 54%, whereas in Britain it is 30%.
Across the EU, 48% think EU membership is a good thing; in Britain, this figure falls to 29%.
On virtually every question, British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country. 
One might think that Britons' aversion to the EU would be reflected in support for, and pride in, their national institutions.
Not so.
British trust in the European Parliament may stand at only 30%; but trust in the Westminster Parliament is much lower, at only 19% - the lowest figure in the EU.
Trust in the national government is a bit higher, but still only 25%, while trust in national political parties is only 10%.
Both figures are, again, the lowest in the EU.
Voters in other states have more confidence in EU institutions, but their opinion of their own institutions is also low.
In France, 57% trust the European Parliament, but only 29% trust the French parliament; while the corresponding figures for Germany are 51% and 23%. 
But the puzzle in the poll is that, even if Europe's voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions as they stand now, 65% of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe, and 72% would support a common defense and security policy; even in Britain, there is 52% support for the idea of a common defense policy.
This may be a reaction to the American-led war in Iraq; but Tony Blair will exclude it precisely for that reason, and a common European defense policy without Britain makes little sense.
The predicament for Europe's leaders at this week's summit is that they stand at the cusp of an unstable process of European integration.
With the accession of 10 new members, the EU must become more integrated if it is to function.
But it is not at all clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to their disillusioned electorates.
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution, which he cannot possibly win.
The central question will be whether Europe's "leaders" deliberately play for failure, in the hope that the problem will go away.
WASHINGTON, DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America’s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending, thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States.
But the agreement has three major flaws.
Two of them offset each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years: economic growth.
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed: coming as they do when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.
The measure’s second shortcoming, however, is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest.
While the legislation does too little to address America’s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited.
The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places.
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving, intact, America’s principal welfare programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, the legislation does not touch either of them.
These programs’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead.
And, because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes, any time, under any circumstances, the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides.
All of the spending cuts come from the “discretionary” part of the federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor, and interest on the national debt.
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut, and much of that goes to the defense budget, which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future.
So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget, which is only about 10% of it.
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead.
Worse yet, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America’s future prosperity and global standing.
Growth is, in the first place, the best way to reduce the country’s budget deficits.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.
Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one, the popular term for which is “the American dream.”
Just as important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a crucial factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership, which dates back to the founding of the country, that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation.
That partnership has five components: wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills; investment in infrastructure – roads, power plants, and ports – that supports commerce; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America’s borders; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth.
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money, and that money is included in the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation.
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers.
Most of the weight will remain, and one’s life prospects will have worsened significantly.
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way.
Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US – and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states.
What's the ordinary European to think?
Europe's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.
Mountains of detail obscure problems; sterile, misleading national discussions that pit "Euroskeptics" against "Europhiles" muster sound and fury but clarify nothing.
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention.
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question: how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations?
To answer this, we need to grasp government's true purpose.
Government should provide citizens with public goods: collective defense, legislation and regulation, enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels: local, regional, national, or supranational government, i.e., the EU.
But what is the right level?
In some areas, decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities.
However, local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities.
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities (that is, interdependence of effects).
Europe's allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest.
The lower a government activity's externalities, the more it should be localized.
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high.
The euro, for example, delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities.
No longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, etc.
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy, the euro's benefits outweigh the costs of diversity.
In educational policy, however, to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance.
It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities, two stand out: the common market and competition; and foreign policy and defense.
The former covers antitrust, trade, and the common currency.
Some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare, to budget balances - should also be harmonized.
But national preferences are diverse, and if mechanically imposed, fiscal centralization might incite resistance.
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d'être from a constitutional point of view.
The US Constitution, for example, does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states.
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified: prohibitions, say, on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition, impeding commerce, or restricting the movement of capital.
Foreign policy and defense belong, par excellence, at government's apex.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas.
Much the same is true in Europe.
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur, which means that fewer centralized policies are justified.
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider:
1.
The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries.
When in doubt, the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme;
2.
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets, including competition, commercial, and monetary policies;
3.
Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized, save for a few exceptions;
4.
Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence, to be delegated to Europe at a proper time;
5.
The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies.
So "No centralization without representation."
Today's EU diverges enormously from these principles (see table), as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture, which represents 2% of European GDP, accounts for 40% of EU expenditures.

Europe faces an historic opportunity.
America's founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years.
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge.
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight.
BEIJING – Before July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth.
It was argued that the United States’ rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio – the result of chronic current-account deficits – would put a sharp brake on capital inflows, in turn weakening the dollar, driving up interest rates, and plunging the US economy into crisis.
But this scenario failed to materialize.
Instead, the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle, which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930’s.
Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis, because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt.
Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt.
In particular, they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt.
In 2007, the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90%, compared to 24% for net foreign debt.
Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability.
But all parts of a country’s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected.
This means two things.
First, funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree: deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components.
Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components.
After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default.
The fall in US total debt, and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds, led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “saving glut.”
Indeed, America’s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar’s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand.
Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession.
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again.
Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment.
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.
But where will increased competitiveness come from?
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution.
Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities, devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America’s budget deficit.
If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.
In the long run, America’s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.
In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.
Thus, China’s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability.
Given that America benefits mightily from China’s purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.
It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future.
The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao’s recent visit to Washington, both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance.
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.
HONG KONG – A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades.
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated, rebuilt by the German peoples' hard work and sacrifice to unify the country, and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I was there to attend.
The conference’s theme was “Paradigm Lost,” with more than 300 economists, political scientists, systems analysts, and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality, rising unemployment, global financial disarray, and climate change.
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political, economic, social, and intellectual.
The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer, owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge.
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental shifts.
In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic.
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.
By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles.
Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.
Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause.
Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time.
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.
European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy.
Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty.
This “predetermined equilibrium” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-correct – led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes’s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction.
By the 1970’s, the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that “finance is a veil,” thereby becoming blind to financial markets’ destabilizing effects.
Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession’s push for free markets and minimal government intervention.
But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.
Even as the world’s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance, four billion of the world’s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status, making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability.
New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:
“As the world enters the modern era, most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce.…This is easier said than done.
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them.
Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.”
Using this macro-historical framework, we can see Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new, multipolar global system.
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (the narrowing of income, wealth, and knowledge gaps between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth, and knowledge gaps within countries).
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it: “Security and justice require centralized governmental control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective.
Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.”
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking.
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.
Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and social harmony without sacrifice – a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations.
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.
Europe could use it.
To many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true.
When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago, expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people.
Until recently, Russia's robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle, because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called "near abroad" as a zone of special interest and influence.
NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's "zone."
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated.
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics, Europe is made a safer place, and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire.
Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities.
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement.
Rightly so: enlargement of NATO is not an "expansion" that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms.
On the contrary, expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union.
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, due in no small part to NATO demands.
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia, Europe, and America now work out their disagreements.
Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU.
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper.
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime.
This, in turn, created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia.
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002.
But this is no cause for complacency.
For the really hard work is only now beginning: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring, as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms, in particular Russia.
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety.
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly.
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave.
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures.
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU, where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea.
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself.
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams.
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true.
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe.
In 1977, when I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department, I was sent to India to dissuade that country's leaders from developing a nuclear bomb.
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China.
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe.
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology.
So far as we know, its leaders have kept their word.
But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's bomb, confirm the danger I predicted back then.
Some call Khan's network an effort to spread an "Islamic bomb," but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran, it might better be termed a corrupt bomb.
As events in Pakistan illustrate, the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence.
Rather, it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons.
That makes everyone less safe.
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any city they chose.
Now the world's attention is focussed on Iran, one recipient of Pakistani technology, as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August, and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities.
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium.
Last October, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures.
In addition, after visits by the French, British, and German foreign ministers, Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program.
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment, and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA.
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
Correct, because the NPT was born with a loophole.
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections, it can legally accumulate enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program, and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice.
If Iran did this, it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region, but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide.
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others.
For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable.
However, America's unilateral options are limited.
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq, but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility, making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent.
In the mid-1970's, many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime, countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan formed a "Nuclear Suppliers Group" that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it.
Today, such countries should join together to offer Iran (and others) a deal.
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel.
For example, Russia, which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor's spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing.
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council.
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions.
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle.
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear.
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan.

NEW YORK – The G-8’s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group’s recent summit in L’Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.
With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.
Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 .
During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.
As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.
Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.

The UN Millennium Project’s Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle.
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs.  The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose.  Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.
Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others.
Now the key is to make this effort work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.
Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children’s health and education.
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.
Perhaps the main risk is that the “aid bureaucracies” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings. “Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.
If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.
Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.
Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.
This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases.
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.
All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.
Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works.
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused.
He was then told to identify himself.
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed. 
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances.
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.
Class and race overlap in the US.
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.
Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.
The field is too full of mines.
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID.
It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
One might argue that itwas.
If not Professor Gates, then who?
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin.
There was no question of violence.
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.
BERLIN – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap.
Indeed, the opposite is true.
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most menacing of all, the risk of military proliferation.
Moreover, the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable.
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity; it is a deliberate political choice.
Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that, at the time, only a minority of people worldwide, largely in the West, benefited from technological progress.
By contrast, the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources, which are indispensable for human survival, are finite, and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have.
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
The energy future of nine billion people, which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century, lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency.
We already know this.
Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?
The answer, ultimately, doesn’t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications.
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige.
Even today, the Bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states have it, and the many that do not.
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union.
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers, which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was framed in the 1960’s.
To this day, it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves.
Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.
To this day, therefore, the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase, particularly given small and medium powers’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts.
Iran is the most current example of this.
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.
Despite the NPT, a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn’t always worked, or worked completely, because the NPT’s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.
From here, then, all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders’ decision to take them.
This political power, not the requirements of energy policy, is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult.
As a rule, the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “civilian” nuclear programs.
The supposed “civilian” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus, for instance, led to a large number of such “civilian” programs in neighboring states.
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
And, of course, the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “clandestine threshold countries.”
So how will the world – first and foremost, the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster?
Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice.
It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the latter-day Soviet Union) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks.
What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course.
Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation.
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union’s future needs.
The CAP must be born again.
Work on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013.
But a much more profound re-think is needed.
The CAP’s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union, which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.
Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens.
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union’s growing wealth.
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.
As the EU has evolved and expanded, food systems have become more complex, involving production, processing, supply-chain organization, and wholesale and retail distribution, with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment.
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny.
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy, entitledGround for Choices, demonstrated that the EU’s food supply could be met with 50% less cultivated land, 80% less pesticides, and at 50% less cost.
Pollution would be reduced by 70% as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water, and greenhouse gases would be cut.
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land, substantial gains could be made in food production.
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP’s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed.
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community.
But that attitude is undermining change.
Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community, with fewer farmers but better farms.
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.
A side benefit for the EU’s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization’s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.
Moreover, the CAP’s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.
If the market “misbehaves,” farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture’s competitiveness.
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country’s agribusiness.
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness, including horticultural seeds, ornamentals, seed potatoes, and veal, are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country’s trade balance.
In the EU as a whole, a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture’s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development.
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation’s “Forward Look on European Food Systems” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe’s landscapes.
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.
These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe’s taxpayers, not more.
They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it.
With donor help, they can.
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.
In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.
This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.
Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.
The current aid structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help. 
The time for business as usual is over.
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.
CAMBRIDGE – With youth unemployment touching 50% in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable?
If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.
At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?
In his provocative American Economic Review paper “A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas,” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were, the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment.
He credited another (future) Nobel Prize winner, James Meade, for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently, especially in the context of Europe’s nascent integration.
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever.
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau.
Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.
Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%.
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960’s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk.
For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.
In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.
Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets.
This claim was hugely misguided.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.
But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time.
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube, much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century.
Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant.
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities.
A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even of Mundell’s labor-mobility criterion, is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving region-wide popular elections.
Europe’s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.
European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.
Perhaps they are right.
But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones.
Europe may never be an “optimum” currency area by any standard.
But, without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade.
OXFORD – In Anthony Burgess’s novella (and Stanley Kubrick’s film) A Clockwork Orange, Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images.
Like Pavlov’s dog, Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex.
This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged.
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired, and the fear that science will be used to make, or even force, people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned.
Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife.
Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “clockwork” that underlies human morality.
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions.
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it.
Indeed, scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity.
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others.
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray, it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders.
Neuroscientists have even magnetically “zapped” carefully targeted areas of people’s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example, making it easier for them to lie.
Of course, no one is developing a “moral pill” that will transform us into saints.
But the research is advancing fast, and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, sentiments, and motivations.
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better?
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch.
But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.
I suspect that many will agree with this view.
They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.
Of course, most of us don’t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture.
But this does not mean that we are morally good, or good enough.
As you read this, perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies, a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency: think of locks, security alarms, police, courts, and prisons.
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others, or give enough to the less fortunate.
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral, but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.
For thousands of years, humans have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to make people behave decently.
We could all be morally better, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further.
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments.
So we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance, by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more persuasive ethical arguments.
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion.
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens’ moral code – we know that if they had such power, they would misuse it.
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy, or, yes, by taking a ’morality’ pill.
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better.
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.
And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who would want it least.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
We don’t yet know what is possible.
But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late.
And even if “moral pills” are just science fiction, they raise deep questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
PRINCETON – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped, but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed.
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban, or was it a reflection of the hardship, both personal and economic, that the ban was causing?
Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, at a cost to airlines of more than $1 billion.
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.
The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.
In the past, jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, and in one case, dropped thousands of feet, although all managed to land safely.
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft, and that no matter how slight that risk might be, the government’s job was, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it, “to make sure that safety was paramount.”
Indeed, in closing their skies, European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else.
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas.
Some 3,000 people die on the world’s roads every day.
Cutting speed limits to, say, 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.
We don’t do it, because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.
It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals.
The British government uses a figure of a little more than £1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example, by improving road safety.
In the US, the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $5.8 million – nearly four times as much, at current exchange rates – for the same purpose.
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US, but not in Britain?
Giovanni Bisignani, the head of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown, saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken.
On the whole, though, the public seemed to support the decision.
Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky.
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?
John Stuart Mill, in his classic book On Liberty, considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.
In Mill’s view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger.
Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make, because only he can judge the importance of his journey, and balance that against the risk he is running.
Air safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew.
If they are fully informed of the risks, and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money, as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly?
In the end, after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage, and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere, Europe’s skies were reopened.
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly.
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety, we know that this is not only a technical question.
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question: how safe should we aim to be?
PRINCETON – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia’s leaders have not changed a whit.
It looks increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news for decades to come.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics.
In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin’s men designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their ur-enemy.
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police; its leaders arrested and beaten; Putin called its supporters “coyotes.”
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger.
Oil prices are soaring, as are Putin’s approval ratings.
His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee.
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies, the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents, and the massive “social investments” of recent years, which, under Medvedev’s personal supervision, have bribed the population, no credible force can seriously challenge Putin’s men.
Yet their regime is in crisis, and they know it.
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been reversed.
Despite increasing incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power; they still die at a shockingly young age.
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.
State monopolies undo what private businesses created.
With more money, ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to rule the country.
The country is unruly, and its rulers know it.
So they panic.
Putin’s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia’s security forces.
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “directed and controlled,” including the KGB.
Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge.
Its people have become powerful, arrogant, and enormously rich.
They have also become disobedient.
In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin’s representative in northwest Russia, published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country.
This essay, more than anything else, defined Putin’s second term.
In October 2007, Cherkesov (now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services, the Federal Anti-Drug Administration) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues’ degradation: warriors had turned into traders, he complained.
Earlier, generals from a competing service, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov’s deputy for “illegal bugging.”
In a public gesture of despair, Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin’s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services.
Cherkesov’s deputy remains in prison. Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense.
In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading, applying force when a trade did not go well.
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin’s circle also confronts this situation.
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another?
Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.
But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones.
Now that Putin’s people have left their predecessors’ neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique, the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services, the administration, business, and much else.
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction.
Preaching nationalism, its managers will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree.
Putin’s lawyers will reverse that decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, corporation, military unit, university department, etc. Integrated by the leader’s charisma and party discipline, party members will direct and unify the desolated country.
This is Putin’s plan.
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party’s general secretary.
As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin.
And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit.
In the end, Putin has what history left him: not ideas, just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power.
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality; Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party.
It is a bizarre ideology.
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, it shuns its Marxist origins.
It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies.
LONDON – Last month, while in New York City, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
To accommodate his security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself.
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks.
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days.
The Israelis refused; another impasse was reached.
What, then, might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land?
The answer is: very poor.
All peace efforts since the Oslo accords of 1993 have been based on the “two-state solution,” according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state, and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after.
A negotiated “land for peace” solution still remains official Western doctrine.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech, “a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace” has to be based on “two states for two peoples.”
Meanwhile, the two main parties to the dispute, Palestine and Israel, are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied “peace process.”
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood, while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that, if the latest peace talks collapse, he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized “Palestine,” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow.
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe, and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between.
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy.
Israel’s main concern continues to be security.
The official Western doctrine is that Israel’s long-term security depends on the success of the “peace process.”
In practice, Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future.
Media attention has been focused on the “security wall,” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence.
But, to the hawks who now control Israeli politics, the key to Israel’s security depends on depth of defense, for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable.
The hawks’ recipe for survival is threefold: continued military and economic support from the US, defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program, and the carve-up of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans, or subordinate authorities, incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy.
Thus, while Abbas seeks to create a new “fact on the ground” by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state, Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable.
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states, but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state.
Indeed, the two-state solution was always an illusion.
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it.
And, over time, Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs.
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper.
These are the “facts on the ground” that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state.
Moreover, land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view.
If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle, there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety, poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid.
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories, with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes.
The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP.
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers’ productivity and taxes.
But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one.
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories.
But it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy, implicitly backed by the US, will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism.
The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states, so Netanyahu’s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas’s pursuit of statehood through international recognition.
Netanyahu’s project is not moral.
But that doesn’t mean that it won’t work, at least for a time.
Time is running out in Kosovo. If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December, the province’s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally – a move that the United States has announced it may support.
That would be a disastrous step.
Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo’s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
Serbia is even more strongly opposed.
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia’s state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty.
Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 “military observers” and 2,116 policemen) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous.
After eight years of international administration, Kosovo’s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence.
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.
Serbia is prepared to concede only “enhanced autonomy” to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements.
Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise.
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene.
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals (for example, admission and circulation of foreigners, or extradition), plus the right to seek admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.
However, a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defence, borders (in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo’s Serbian minority.
As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects, bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body.
Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government’s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, whereas the Kosovar government’s “sovereignty” over Kosovo would be restrained.
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions, the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates, and three representatives of the EU, thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates.
In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (say, 5,000 troops) to back up the common body’s decisions.
As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement.
Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority.
Kosovo would acquire limited independence, with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN.
The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area.
Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent.
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.
Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as occurred in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or, pushed by centrifugal forces, split up (as with the United Arab Republic, established in 1958, which split three years later into Egypt and Syria).
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage (lasting five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent.
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo’s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing “sovereign authority” with other independent states, which could deflate Kosovars’ dangerously robust nationalistic demands.
NEW YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory?
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation, documentation, and inference that takes shape – usually on the Internet – and spreads virally around the globe.
In the process, conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse, where they were generally consigned in the past, and sometimes into the very heart of politics.
I learned this by accident.
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation.
There are some major themes.
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting – via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others – to establish a “One World Government” dominated by themselves rather than national governments.
Sometimes, more folkloric details come into play, broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes Scholars, or, as always, the Jews.
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis.
In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims.
Historically, there tends to be the same set of themes: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks – rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse – primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering.
Similarly, the “9/11 Truth Movement” asserts that al-Qaeda’s attack on the Twin Towers was an “inside job.”
In the Muslim world, there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks, and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day.
Usually, conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking.
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays?
Today’s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly designated “enemy” with an unmistakable “plan” is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings – or failures – of unfettered capitalism.
And, while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they address are often healthy, even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong.
In seeking answers, these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities.
Many citizens believe, rightly, that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses.
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding, and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut.
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust, setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum.
Likewise, in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies, many people believe, again rightly, that their elected officials no longer represent them.
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.
Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because, in the last eight years, we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies.
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war, using fabricated evidence to do so.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque?
When even the 9/11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence derived from torture), is it surprising that many want a second investigation?
Frequently enough, it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse – pursuing such theories – who report on news that the mainstream media ignores.
For example, it took a “conspiracy theorist,” Alex Jones, to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens. The New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source.
The mainstream media’s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias.
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow.
So even good, critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists.
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview, and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions.
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia.
In a fevered environment, without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing, citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues, as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin’s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists.
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information, pitch stories, and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters.
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting, unmediated by corporate pressures.
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and eschewing anonymity – that is, standing by their own bylines, as conventional reporters do.
This is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation.
In a time of official lies, healthy investigative energy should shed light, not just generate heat.
Changing constitutions is always a risky business.
But it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone.
Indeed, when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office, you can be certain that he is up to no good.
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted.
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones.
No, Kuchma wants to change Ukraine's constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power.
Today, Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president.
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again.
So, instead of retiring gracefully, as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do, Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term.
Of course, constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten.
Constitutions can, and should, accommodate reform when necessary.
A powerful president, however, is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine.
In our wrenching postcommunist transition, it is essential that a government can act decisively.
To change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine's circumstances, you need a good reason.
The Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister, dissolve parliament if he wishes, and rule by decree if he judges that the country's institutions are in danger.
He maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government.
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach.
Kuchma is not.
On the contrary, what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution, but its president, who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists, and who is shunned by other world leaders.
As president, Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular.
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall.
So Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor, as Yeltsin did in Russia.
Unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor, Kuchma wants what he calls a "parliamentary republic" with a weak president and powerful prime minister.
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutant, one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue, unabated, behind the facade of parliamentary procedure.
People too easily forget Ukraine, this big country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union.
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma's rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early 1990's into outright dictatorship and chaos.
Indeed, this scenario could worsen, because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel.
Intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances.
Only an imperial Russia, however, would dare reabsorb Ukraine.
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia.
So Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine, but ultimately threatens Russia's democracy as well.
Luckily, there has never been a better time for the West--particularly the EU--to nudge Ukraine back from the brink.
With EU expansion coming next spring, all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union's easternmost border in Poland.
Although the job of maintaining Ukraine's democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians, the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they won't be cut off from the rest of Europe.
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland, are two possible inducements.
But these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the country's constitution and democracy alone.
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
After all, it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state, Austria, on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country's democracy.
The wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior.
Similarly, the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchma's decision to send troops to Iraq.
It cannot be the case that America's fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased.
Within Ukraine, a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done, thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchma's criminal cronies flourish.
The constitution must be reformed, but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another.
What is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule, and transparency in decision-making.
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power, no matter what.
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election (or any other kind of election) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule.
It is, after all, President Kuchma who is discredited, not Ukraine's constitutional arrangements.
NEW YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession: it is mainly Europe and the United States, not the major emerging markets, that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment.
And it is Europe and America that are marching, alone and together, to the denouement of a grand debacle.
A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession, but that also fueled substantial budget deficits.
The response – massive spending cuts – ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment (a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering) will continue, possibly for years.
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members.
It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro’s very survival was in growing jeopardy.
Europe’s leaders recognized that distressed countries’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow, and that growth could not be achieved without assistance.
But, even as Europe’s leaders promised that help was on the way, they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending.
The resulting austerity will hinder Europe’s growth, and thus that of its most distressed economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners.
And low growth will hurt tax revenues, undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation.
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank’s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece’s bad sovereign debt, for fear that any private-sector involvement (PSI) would trigger a “credit event,” which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps (CDSs), possibly fueling further financial turmoil.
But, if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital.
Likewise, the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage to ratings agencies’ decisions about what constitutes a “credit event.”
Indeed, one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies.
Indeed, the most curious aspect of the ECB’s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event.
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable.
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, surely they were safer after the restructuring, and thus equally acceptable.
This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions, with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend to be captured (at least “cognitively”) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate.
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic.
There, the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government, confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don’t get their way confront rational individuals, the former prevail.
As a result, President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy, with no tax increases – not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades, and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies, which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation.
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America’s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year.
But the payroll-tax cut (which put more than $100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans) was not renewed, and surely business, anticipating the contractionary effects down the line, will be even more reluctant to lend.
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary.
And, with housing prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment remaining stubbornly high (one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one), more stimulus, not austerity, is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well.
The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues, owing to poor economic performance; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work.
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction.
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
After all, America’s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe’s problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US – especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs.
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas move easily across borders, and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other.
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring.
The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming, and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences.
Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank, the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming, but whether we can afford not to.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought.
Indeed, the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs: for instance, climate change may lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream – of particular concern to Europe – and a flourishing of disease.
When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution, that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases, and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels.
But few saw, for instance, the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case.
Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing.
To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less.
As one scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail, and a fog bank rolls in, should you drive more or less cautiously?
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.
As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.
To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause.
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating.
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate.
This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes.
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work.
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, in this case he has called for voluntary action.
But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits, regardless of the cost to others.
Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funded “research” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer.
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol, and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries.
Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.
Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference.
For example, simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning.
We have but one planet, and should treasure it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.
LONDON – Reading Barack Obama’sDreams from My Father, the US president’s beautifully written reflections on his early life and identity, most people are struck by his cool and intellectual approach.
This is not to say that he is unemotional.
Obama can rage and weep.
But he rarely seems to act on the basis of raw sentiment or instinctive prejudice.
Pragmatic and highly intelligent, sooner or later every issue receives the full attention of his forensic curiosity.
Recalling Hillary Clinton’s famous Democratic primary television advertisement, Obama, it turns out, is exactly the sort of president that most of us would want to have in the post for that 3 a.m. phone call about an international crisis.
He would not be afraid to act, but he would be prepared to think first.
I do not think, therefore, that Obama will be too vexed by some of the criticism he faces at the end of his first year in office, though he will undoubtedly grimace at the defeat of the Democratic candidate in the special election in Massachusetts to fill Ted Kennedy’s old seat.
Obama was praised extravagantly a year ago; 12 months on, the criticism is over the top, too.
Obama inherited a terrible legacy – recession, financial meltdown, Iraq, Afghanistan.
He has not solved all of these problems.
But it is difficult to see any really bad mistakes, except perhaps allowing himself to be pushed around by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and giving China the impression that he was prepared for a bilateral relationship entirely on China’s terms.
That seems to be changing now.
Obama may have come to understand that when you are the leader of the world’s only superpower, you need to be feared just a little if you are to be respected.
The left in America criticizes Obama for not turning the economy around already.
The right angrily denounces him as a crypto-communist because he wants every American to have health care.
With a dispassionate eye on the long game, what will the president himself be thinking?
One issue that Obama is certain to have in his sights is a problem that shadowed the world for years.
When I was growing up in the 1950’s and 1960’s, world peace was based on the nuclear standoff between the US and the Soviet Union.
The main strategic assessment on both sides of the Berlin Wall was that if either side made a wrong move, all of us might end up consumed in the flames of a nuclear holocaust.
This was called, in the geostrategic jargon of the day, “mutually assured destruction,” or MAD.
The acronym was entirely appropriate.
We have forgotten those days.
Yet there are still 23,000 nuclear warheads on our planet, with the explosive power of 150,000 Hiroshima bombs.
Terrorist groups would undoubtedly like to get their hands on one.
In all, there are eight nuclear-weapon states – the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, Israel, India, and Pakistan.
North Korea may also have a few bombs.
Iran is believed by many to be trying to develop one.
Other states, which have their own civil nuclear capacity, have the potential to develop a weapon.
The number of countries in this category is bound to increase as the number of nuclear power reactors doubles over the next 20 years.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has contained the number of nuclear states.
A conference is to be held in May to renew and review it.
Obama clearly recognizes that the NPT needs to be strengthened in order to prevent countries from turning their civil nuclear-power capacity into weapons.
But Obama also knows that if the existing nuclear states want others to accept tougher restrictions, they will have to cut back their nuclear arsenals.
This is principally an issue for the US and Russia, which possess 95% of the world’s nuclear weapons.
In addition, it would help if the US could take a strong lead by ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
The nuclear issue is one of the biggest items on the Obama agenda.
How it is handled will help to define his presidency.
Even before the talking gets serious in May, there will be the question of Iran to sort out.
Iran says that it seeks no more than its own ability to produce nuclear power.
Disbelief grows with every revelation of secret Iranian facilities and plans, and with every refusal by Iran to negotiate safeguards that would allow for civil use while preventing weaponization.
The US, the European Union, and Russia have tried to engage Iran on this issue, so far without success.
China seems likely to block effective sanctions on Iran because of its close energy relationship with the country.
How China eventually handles this will profoundly affect its standing in the US and Europe.
These are going to be some of the major questions for Obama over the next year and more.
If he gets them right, he can forget about his short-term critics.
Fortunately, he is smart enough to know this.
MUNICH – For a while, it looked as if the European Central Bank’s €1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe’s banking system had calmed global financial markets.
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%.
Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable.
After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced.
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.
Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden.
The main problem is Spain, where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy combined, and, as in Greece, is in the neighborhood of 100% of GDP (93% to be precise).
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain’s youth are unemployed, reflecting the country’s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period.
The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again.
Moreover, Spain’s debt with the ECB’s TARGET settlement system rose by €55 billion ($72 billion) between February and March, because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated.
Since July 2011, Spain’s TARGET debt has grown by €199 billion.
Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010.
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.
The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years.
The country’s TARGET debt grew by €76 billion from February to March, with the total since July 2011 reaching €276 billion.
Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB’s liquidity injection.
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy, because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital.
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.
In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.
Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly.
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France’s TARGET debt increased by €95 billion.
France, too, has become uncompetitive, owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years.
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the country’s price level must drop by an estimated 20% vis-à-vis the euro average – that is, depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone.
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%.
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone.
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation.
For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze.
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels – bailout funds, eurobonds, or the ECB – from the eurozone’s healthy core to the troubled South.
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree.
Already German, Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to €15,000, €17,000, and €21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB.
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.
Above all, however, the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity, if not to Europe’s economic collapse, because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment.
Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system’s main steering mechanism.
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe’s politicians have started down this slippery slope.
LONDON – Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis.
That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed.
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “Our distrust is very expensive.” The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: “It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.
Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment.
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust.
In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret.
In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous.
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government.
The market will prove one side right before too long.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.
Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior.
In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.
So falling trust had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply.
This has been positive for the stock market.
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration’s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government’s ability to regulate.
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground.
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business.
Others are congenitally distrustful.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals’ income.
A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two.
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.
The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?
It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average.
In other words, if you diverge markedly from society’s average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused.
When anyone I don’t know says “trust me” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet.
Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same.
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much.
NEW HAVEN – Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes.
So, not surprisingly, economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end, either.
Of course, we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis: people are not spending, because their incomes have fallen, their jobs are insecure, or both.
But we can take it a step further back: people’s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on, backwards in time, in a repeating feedback loop.
It is a vicious circle, but where and why did it start?
Why did it worsen?
What will reverse it?
It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers.
The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash.
Economists did not predict that event, either.
In the 1920’s, some warned about an overpriced stock market, but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy.
Late in the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden inThe Christian Science Monitor reported an informal set of interviews with US “professors, banking experts, union leaders, and representatives of business associations and political factions,” all of whom were given the same question: “What causes recessions?” The multiplicity of answers seemed bewildering, and did not inspire confidence that anyone knew what was causing the deepest crisis of capitalism.
The causes given were “distributed widely among government, labor, industry, international politics and policies.” They included misguided government interference with markets, high income and capital gains taxes, mistaken monetary policy, pressures towards high wages, monopoly, overstocked inventories, uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court, rearmament in Europe and fear of war, government encouragement of labor disputes, a savings glut because of population shrinkage, the passing of the frontier, and easy credit before the depression.
Although economic theory today is much improved, if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers.
We would certainly hear some new ones, too: unprecedented real-estate bubbles, a global savings glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, sub-prime mortgages, unregulated over-the-counter markets, rating agencies’ errors, compromised real-estate appraisals, and complacency about counterparty risk.
More likely than not, many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right, for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors, the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things, which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point.
At that point, the trouble grabbed widespread attention, destroyed public confidence, and set in motion a negative feedback loop.
Our attention, after all, is naturally drawn to the worst events.&nbsp;Precisely because the worst events are statistical outliers, their causes are probably multiple.
Consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which killed more than 200,000 people.
It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage.
But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage, one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors – including even political, financial, and insurance factors – that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis.
Indeed, the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes.
For, in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways, events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon, which, by flapping its wings, sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane.
Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions, and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future.
Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future, either, but at least they have precise mathematical models.
Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics.&nbsp;Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather, even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far.
The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize.
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects, but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid, immutable theory.
The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis, Carmen Reinhart’s and Kenneth Rogoff’sThis Time Is Different, is essentially a summary of lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in recorded history.
But the book is almost entirely non-theoretical.
It merely documents recurrent patterns.
Unfortunately, in 800 years of financial history, there is only one example of a really massive worldwide contraction, namely the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it is hard to know exactly what to expect in the current contraction based on the Reinhart-Rogoff analysis.
This leaves us trying to use patterns from past, dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis.
As a result, we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing.
CAMBRIDGE – Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates?
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people’s feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that “the whole government is a Ponzi scheme.”
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008.
Personally, I suspect Madoff’s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while.
Still, with many of the world’s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented old-age pension obligations, and a downshift in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is.
In a new paper, “A Decade of Debt,” Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.
Japan, of course, is in even worse shape, with government debt totaling more than 200% of GDP.
Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves, Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs – and this on top of its depressing demographic trends.
Many other rich countries’ debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs, despite relative peace in much of the world.
There is a no easy way out.
For now, low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, whereas real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise far more quickly, even for rich countries.
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity.
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts.
In principle, an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts.
It is high time to consider novel approaches.
Of course, no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems.
And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises.
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic.
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start.
A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
But, while these older institutions have proven enormously useful, they are typically quite constrained.
The CBO, for example, is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth, but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future “fixes” at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies.
To enhance credibility, a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence, often with central banks as a role model.
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada.
The remit of Sweden’s fiscal council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to forecast, but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy.
In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis.
In the US, such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk.
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least anytime soon.
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy.
And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional.
Still, the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity.
Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are.
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say, “My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I, so who cares if they have to pay some debt?” Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias, as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment.
To resist these powerful pressures, fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability.
To be sure, Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right, and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever.
But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits.
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape.
The fall of Milosevic does not cure the political woes of the Balkans; indeed, it raises their urgency.
Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the disintegration is incomplete.
It was in Yugoslavia that Vojislav Kostunica was elected president, but his mandate comes solely from support in Serbia.
Montenegro, Serbia’s junior partner in the Yugoslav federation, mostly boycotted the election while Albanians in Kosovo ignored them.
Yet it was Yugoslavia, whose foundations are unstable, that was recently admitted to the UN.
A host of problems remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia’s northern province of Vojvodina).
Any resolution – any suggestion of change – will engender new conflicts because of conflicting claims of sovereignty.
However tempting it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new borders or establishing new entities, this conundrum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty.
That traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans.
A new approach is needed: the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as the way to promote regional integration.
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe.
This idea has great appeal to people in the region, but only the EU can make it happen.
After NATO intervention in Kosovo, European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans. It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July, 1999.
But the Stability Pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content.
The time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November 24 called by France as the current EU president.
The European Union should now propose a three-point plan for the Balkans:
$ a customs union with preferential access to EU markets within one year.
The existing EU-Turkey customs union should be used as a model.
Once all these countries reach agreement with the EU there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans.
This will take some time to implement.
But from the start, the EU should give a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region.
This cannot endanger any EU interests as the countries at issue now have far less than 1% of the EU market.
$ a regional VAT to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years.
Differences in indirect taxes such as VAT pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade.
They should be unified throughout the region.
Regional VAT rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union.
$ Temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years, subject to EU supervision over budgetary expenditures.
Because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional VAT, the EU should provide financial help during the transition.
The area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
Participation by Romania and Moldova is optional.
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate provided it would not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership.
Depending on the country, there could be more or less budgetary support.
(Bulgaria, for example, might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs).
In comparison to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping, the financial costs here are ridiculously low.
I estimate that Euro 750 million in the first year, Euro 500 million in the second year and Euro 250 million in the third year would do the trick.
(If Romania and Moldova were included the figures would be slightly higher).
These figures are well within range of pledges already made by the EU for the Stability Pact and they could be easily accommodated within the confines of the Berlin Accord on the EU budget for 2000-2005 if EU member states agree to a reallocation of unspent funds.
Budgetary support in the context of a Customs Union would be a more effective way to disburse EU funds than conventional methods.
This three-point program would lay the ground for economic resurgence.
It would remove two major sources of corruption and inefficiency: the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general.
It would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment.
The Deutsche Mark, already widely used in the region, now functions as the de facto common currency.
Any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment.
Improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions, in turn, would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans.
Serbia has climbed part of the way out of the abyss.
Success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal.
But that process has a long way to go.
The opposition inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins.
The population, frustrated by ever deepening impoverishment and isolation, is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in Serbia.
People are asking about crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against Serbs.
They must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Once that process is underway, many problems that now seem intractable will be resolved more easily.
Kostunica’s election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution: many of the old guard are still in place.
The momentum created by Milosevic’s overthrow needs to be maintained.
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia’s isolation.
Europe must now fulfill its promise.
If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb, an historic opportunity will be lost.
PRAGUE – As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union, I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain’s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as “a faraway country of which we know little.”
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld’s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between “new and old” Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude. 
The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was.
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old.
We Czechs are 100% European, and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe.
Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new.
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.
On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed.
The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU.
Unfortunately, conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve.
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread, because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe’s young people, who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few.
It will fall to the Union, once again, to help transform despair into hope.
We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.
To contain today’s financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point.
The very existence of our Union, and particularly of the euro, has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930’s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn. 
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check.
For now, EU governments’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times, its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro.
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen.
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated.
Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year, but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold.
Now those talks have resumed, but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically.
Russia’s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members.
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia’s budget, and lack of investment in the country’s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted.
Until now, Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU, because two-thirds of Russia’s exports to the Union comprise natural resources, which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides.
Given the stark changes in economic conditions, however, it is now in Russia’s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business, for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia.
Indeed, many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia’s closest friend in the Union.
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members, and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole.  Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia. 
Europe’s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism, important as that undoubtedly is, but its unity.
When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe united around a single position on Russia’s withdrawal.
It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward.
During the 1990’s, the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect.  It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms.
We, like all EU presidencies, will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate.
PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age.
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is 350 Day.
The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world’s leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.
The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming – denounced as “alarmist” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative.
We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do.
The melting of arctic ice is one example.
Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary “Northeast Passage” across the north of Europe and Russia to China.
They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest.
This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays.
An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice.  In other words, our greenhouse gas emissions have, by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice, created a feedback loop that will generate more warming, and melt more ice, even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow.
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.
In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called “permafrost” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen.
But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane.
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.
At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that, while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its greatest impact will probably be on Africa, which has few resources to cope with the challenge.
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs.
The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid, but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our waste gases.
Sri Lanka took a similar stance, using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008, environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person.
In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.
But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it.
As Sri Lanka’s government pointed out, “That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent.”
This situation is an injustice of vast proportions, reminiscent of – and arguably much worse than – the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century.
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.
Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as “strong action” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm.
In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.
On October 24, people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2.
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted.
Atwww.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in, or put your own idea online.
But don’t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact.
One day your grandchildren will ask you: what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time?
When I was seven years old, in 1960, my grandmother Angelica opened my eyes to the meaning of 8 May 1945, the day when Nazi Germany surrendered and World War II ended in Europe.
We were spending our summer holidays in Normandy where the liberation of Europe from Nazism had started on D-Day, 6 June 1944.
One evening, I listened to my parents and my grandmother talking about the past.
I have forgotten the details of their conversation, but I can still hear my grandmother’s sigh of relief when she said “Thank God we lost that war!”
From a child’s perspective, it wasn’t self-evident that losing was a good thing.
But of course, my grandmother was right to equate defeat with liberation.
The more I have thought about the lesson she taught me 45 years ago, the clearer I have seen another, less obvious dimension in what she said: It is “we” who lost the war.
Collectively, the Germans had not been the innocent victims of a small gang of criminal outsiders called “Nazis” – Nazism had been an inside ideology supported by millions of Germans, and every German was liable for its atrocities whether or not he or she had adhered to it individually.
In today’s Germany, an overwhelming majority subscribes to the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation – not only for Europe, but also for Germany itself.
Compared to public opinion in 1960, that’s certainly an enormous progress.
But paradoxically, it may also contain an element of forgetfulness, because it tends to conceal the fact that liberation required a military defeat.
To use my grandmother’s parlance, it is not “us” who were the liberators, but “them”.
The way people see the past tells us more about their present attitudes than about the past itself.
This is what the term “politics of memory” is meant to indicate.
And this is why it doesn’t matter whether the relevant events happened 60 years ago (as World War II), 90 years (as in the case of the Armenian genocide) or even 600 years (such as the battle of Kosovo in 1389).
A violent conflict in the past may survive as a war of memories in the present, as can be observed in the current dispute between China and South Korea on one side, and Japan on the other.
A war of memories, in turn, may sometimes lead to a violent conflict in the future.
Former perpetrators often try to de-legitimize their former victims’ moral superiority by claiming they were victims themselves.
Therefore, the 60th anniversary of the firebombing of Dresden by Allied forces on 13 February 1945 has probably been a more crucial moment in terms of the German “politics of memory” than the 60th anniversary of 8 May 1945 is going to be.
Far-right groups infamously dubbed the attack by which at least 30,000 people were killed “Dresden’s Holocaust of bombs.”
Fortunately, their propaganda campaign has been a failure.
Although it is true that thousands of the civilians killed in Dresden and other German cities were innocent at an individual level, there can be no doubt it was morally imperative that Germany be defeated collectively.
On the left side of the German political spectrum, the proposition that 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation remains unchallenged.
However, it is sometimes repressed that the massive use of force had been necessary to achieve that result.
Left-wing pacifism tends to overlook this simple fact.
Its slogan “Never again war!” is only half the truth – the other half is “Never again appeasement!” 8 May 1945 was not “zero hour,” as a popular saying in Germany goes.
It had an antecedent, that is, a lack of pre-emptive resistance at home and abroad to the threat that built up in Nazi Germany during the 1930’s.
There is yet another lesson to be learned.
Yes, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation to which the Soviet army contributed decisively.
But for millions of Central and East Europeans, liberation was followed by Stalin’s oppressive regime.
The current war of memories between the Baltic republics and Russia, with regard to the international celebration in Moscow on 9 May this year, reminds Germany of a special historic responsibility.
The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the so-called Hitler-Stalin pact, concluded in August 1939, had been supplemented by a secret appendix dividing the border states Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania into spheres of interest for the two parties.
But excusing Nazi atrocities by pointing to Stalinist crimes is an intellectually and morally unacceptable stratagem.
When Chancellor Schröder travels to Moscow for the Red Square celebrations, he should bear in mind Nazi Germany’s contribution to the Baltic tragedy.
On 8 May this year, public speakers will remind us how important it is not to forget.
They will stress that if the lessons of history are not learned, history is bound to repeat itself.
All this is perfectly true.
But personally, I will also remember my grandmother’s sentence “Thank God we lost that war!” Thank God – and thanks to all those brave Allied soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Europe’s liberty.
Cambridge – It may take a few months or a couple of years, but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today’s crisis.
The world economy, however, is unlikely to look the same.
Even with the worst of the crisis over, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world, one in which international trade grows at a slower pace, there is less external finance, and rich countries’ appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished.
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
Not necesarily.
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants.
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing.
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms.
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products. 
The first two models are at greater risk than the third.
But we should not lose sleep over them, because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable.
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group.
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today’s new realities.
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end.
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy.
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services, such as housing and construction.
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts, for similar reasons.  Commodity prices tend to move in cycles.
When they are high, they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other, non-traditional tradables.
Moreover, commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions, leading to costly struggles for resource rents, which are rarely invested wisely.
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady, long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured and other “modern” goods.
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products, these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities.
Their governments pursued not just good “fundamentals” (e.g., macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation), but also what might be called “productivist” policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls.
China exemplified this approach.
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods.
In recent years, China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US – the counterpart of its undervalued currency.
But it wasn’t just China.
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows, because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies.
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future.
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services.
In the past, this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits.
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries.
So, are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other?
Will developing countries’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world’s intolerance of trade imbalances?
There is in fact no inherent conflict, once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses, nor even the volume of their exports.
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods (and services), which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously.
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus.
By encouraging industrial production directly, it is possible to have the upside without the downside.
There are many ways that this can be done, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure.
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument.
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances.
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood.
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate.
Another is that external policy actors (for example, the World Trade Organization) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate.
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances.
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially with the military response to terrorism.
American foreign policy reflects that obsession.
This year, the US will spend around $450 billion for the military, including the costs of the Iraq War, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases.
In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment.
Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession.
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, and took up almost the entire UN agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues, and emphasizing the military response to it, will not bring prosperity and peace, or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria.
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive, failing approach of America's government.
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word.
He declared in London recently that "the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required."
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges.
For example, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, America signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7% of national income.
That would bring an additional $60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year.
Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled.
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992.
It has so far failed to act.
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
Yet at Cancun, Mexico earlier this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies.
The list goes on and on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty, yet it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protect global ecosystems, yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then.
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN.
But because the US is the richest, most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating.
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere.
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses.
The US represents just 5% of the world's population, and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines--should say, "We need to act on the issues that concern us, not just on the issues that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness.
Turkey's seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey's conflict between its "strategic alliance" with America and its drive to join the EU.
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU.
Some liberal elements of that "secular" coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament.
After coming to power, the AKP's leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as "conservative democrats," energetically engaged with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq, from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey.
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey's "secular" state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board, the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West.
The US, preoccupied with the supposed specter of a "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West, saw the AKP's modern, westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey.
Today, both "conservative democrats" and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU, while opponents include extreme nationalists, of both left and right, as well as some elements of the "secular" establishment.
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December's summit of EU leaders.
Instead, the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again, putting off formal negotiations that, in any case, may take years to complete.
Europe's persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary.
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military's domestic political role.
The paradox is that, by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey's options, Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey's status as a military outpost of the US.
At least, that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq.
Then, despite massive US pressure, Turkey's parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory.
Turkey's refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war.
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort no current EU member could have contemplated.
Parliament's rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate.
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government's true "Islamic" character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully "secularist"--voted against the plan.
Likewise, other elements of Turkey's secular establishment, including the President and the military leadership, either opposed or were lukewarm, at best, to the idea of war in Iraq.
Turkey's military initially remained silent on the issue, uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold.
By contrast, the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus.
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives: either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state, or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship.
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament, which, in voting down the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war.
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops.
In fact, the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US, consult with the Turkish military and President, and share all information with the public and parliament.
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation, the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament.
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally.
After the US military action in Iraq, the tables may be turning in surprising ways.
As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military significance may decline.
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey's symbolic importance as a role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform.
With careful management, Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe, while rebuilding its relationship with America.
CAMBRIDGE – This year is likely to mark a make-or-break ordeal for the euro.
The eurozone’s survival demands a credible solution to its long-running sovereign-debt crisis, which in turn requires addressing the two macroeconomic imbalances –&nbsp;external and fiscal –&nbsp;which are at the heart of that crisis.
The crisis has exposed the deep disparities in competitiveness that have developed within the eurozone.
From 1996 to 2010, unit labor costs in Germany increased by just 8%, and by 13% in France.
Compare that to 24% in Portugal, 35% in Spain, 37% in Italy, and a whopping 59% in Greece.
The result has been large trade imbalances between eurozone countries, a problem compounded by large fiscal deficits and high levels of public debt in southern Europe (and France) – much of it owed to foreign creditors.
Does addressing these imbalances require breaking up the eurozone?
Suppose, for example, that Portugal were to leave and re-introduce the escudo.
The ensuing exchange-rate devaluation would immediately lower the price of Portugal’s exports, raise its import prices, stimulate the economy, and bring about much-needed growth.
But a euro exit would be a messy affair.
The resulting turmoil could very well trump any short-term gains in competitiveness from devaluation.
There is a remarkably simple alternative that does not require southern Europe’s troubled economies to abandon the euro and devalue their exchange rates.
It involves increasing the value-added tax while cutting payroll taxes.
Our recent research demonstrates that such a “fiscal devaluation” has very similar effects on the economy in terms of its impact on GDP, consumption, employment, and inflation.
A currency devaluation works by making imports more costly and exports cheaper.
A VAT/payroll-tax swap would do exactly the same thing.
An increase in VAT raises the price of imported goods, as foreign firms face a higher tax.
To ensure that domestic firms do not have an incentive to raise prices, an increase in VAT needs to be accompanied by a cut in payroll taxes.
Moreover, since exports are exempt from VAT, the price of domestic exports will fall.
The desired competitiveness effects of exchange-rate devaluation can thus be had while staying in the euro.
This policy can also help on the fiscal front.
As is true of an exchange-rate devaluation, the positive impact on growth of an increase in competitiveness can strengthen the fiscal position by raising tax revenues.
Moreover, an important advantage of fiscal devaluations is that they generate additional revenues in proportion to the country’s trade deficit.
For countries that are suffering from weak competitiveness and, as a consequence, running trade deficits, this typically means more revenues, especially in the short run.
Like exchange-rate devaluations, fiscal devaluations create winners and losers.
Both act as a wealth levy: inflation means that bondholders suffer a real loss in proportion to their wealth and the size of the devaluation.
If taxes on capital are not adjusted, holders of domestic stocks suffer a comparable loss.
By contrast, many transfers, such as unemployment benefits, health benefits, and public pensions, are indexed to inflation, and thus maintain their real value.
The same is true of minimum wages.
These distributive effects play an important role in the politics of exchange-rate devaluations, and most of these effects appear in fiscal devaluations as well.
Fiscal devaluations already have some advocates.
Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s government just announced one.
And concerns that a fiscal devaluation will conflict with euro rules can be met by simply pointing out that Germany’s government carried one out in 2007, though by another name, when it raised VAT from 16% to 19% and cut employers’ contribution to social insurance, from 6.5% to 4.2%.
In short, there are simple fiscal alternatives to exchange-rate devaluation that can address southern Europe’s short-term competitiveness problems.
To be sure, feasible fiscal devaluations would be limited in size.
But, together with debt restructuring, accommodative monetary policy, liquidity support from the European Central Bank, and much-required structural reforms, they can help to put these troubled economies on a sound footing without a euro breakup or a major austerity-induced recession.
COPENHAGEN – Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change, many countries – including Brazil, Australia, the United States, and the members of the European Union – passed laws in the 2000’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs.
The intention was understandable: if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), we could save 3.5% of all electricity, or 1% of our CO2 emissions.
The current attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to roll back America’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion.
Many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers.
But it’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming.
Let’s be clear: we do need to tackle climate change.
But this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions.
Burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits, and we should weigh those benefits against the costs.
A tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage.
The best estimate of this is about $7/ton of CO2 or $0.06/gallon of gasoline (€0.015/liter).
Most developed countries already have a tax of this size (and often much larger) on electricity and fossil fuels, although this also incorporates the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity.
While CFLs are more expensive to buy, they are much cheaper over their lifespan, because they use much less energy (even more so with the cost of CO2 factored into taxes on electricity).
Thus, on a straightforward cost-benefit basis, it seems to make sense for most people to switch from incandescent bulbs to the new, greener technology.
This is what is great about technological solutions to climate change: if an alternative option is cheaper, people will start using it.
My household uses CFLs, and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO2 emissions and spending less money.
Why, then, is it even necessary to outlaw the old bulbs?
The reason is that monetary cost is only one factor.
Many people find it annoying that CFLs take time to “warm up.”
Or they believe that their light is “funny.”
Or they worry that the bulbs can spread poisonous mercury if they break.
For some people, energy-efficient bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines.
The up-front cost is a factor, too, especially for those on low budgets.
And in places where lights are not used very often, a lower-price incandescent bulb can cost less overall than the energy-efficient alternative.
You might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves.
But proponents of phasing out access to incandescent bulbs argue that they know better.
As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently, “We are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.”
Setting aside other possible objections to this view, there is the problem that it presumes that all incandescent bulbs are worth less than $7/ton of CO2.
This is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs, or for those who are seriously worried about mercury, or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs.
The solution should be to focus on improving the technology – making the lights safer, brighter, warm up faster, and save more energy, so that more people will replace more of their lights.
But it is not just light bulbs that policymakers have tried to ban.
EU parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to outlaw patio heaters, which one MEP declared to be “a luxury the planet cannot afford.”
Who decides when something is luxurious?
And where does this end?
Should we outlaw air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious?
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with fewer CO2 emissions?
It makes sense to reflect the cost of CO2 (among many other factors) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our patios; but when the phase-out proceeds more slowly than some lawmakers wish, a ban is not the right solution.
Real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior.
CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way, but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives.
This is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong.
Governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions, while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs.
Limiting access to the ‘wrong’ light bulbs or patio heaters, ultimately, is not the right path.
We will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options.
Then, people the world over will choose to use them.
TOKYO – 2009 was a good year for China.
The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession.
American President Barack Obama visited China, more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world’s greatest superpower.
Even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted: failure in its attempt to commit China, or any other industrial nation, to making significant cuts in carbon emissions, with the United States getting the blame.
The Chinese government, under the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident.
So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison, just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule?
Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition, Charter 08, signed by thousands of Chinese, calling for basic rights to be respected. Liu is not a violent rebel.
His opinions, in articles published on the Internet, are entirely peaceful.
Yet he was jailed for “inciting subversion of state power.”
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd.
And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him, to prevent others from expressing similar views.
Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions, or even peaceful petitions, so dangerous?
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks.
Without legitimacy, no government can rule with any sense of confidence.
There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements.
Liberal democracy is only a recent invention.
Hereditary monarchy, often backed by divine authority, has worked in the past.
And some modern autocrats, such as Robert Mugabe, have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters.
China has changed a great deal in the last century, but it has remained the same in one respect: it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics.
Legitimacy is not based on the give and take, the necessary compromises, and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy.
Instead, the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief, imposed from above, in ideological orthodoxy.
In imperial China, this meant Confucian orthodoxy.
The ideal of the Confucian state is “harmony.”
If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs, including moral codes of behavior, conflicts will disappear.
The ruled, in this ideal system, will naturally obey their rulers, just as sons obey their fathers.
After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism.
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals, because it was bookish, introduced a modern moral orthodoxy, and was based, like Confucianism, on a promise of perfect harmony.
Ultimately, in the Communist utopia, conflicts of interests would melt away.
Chairman Mao’s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism.
This orthodoxy, however, was also destined to fade away.
Few Chinese, even in the top ranks of the Communist Party, are convinced Marxists anymore.
This left an ideological vacuum, swiftly filled in the 1980’s by greed, cynicism, and corruption.
Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China, collectively known as “Tiananmen.”
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom.
Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen, a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism: Chinese nationalism.
Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation.
The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power.
To doubt this was not just mistaken, but unpatriotic, even “anti-Chinese.”
From this perspective, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views were indeed subversive.
They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy, and thus on the legitimacy of the state.
To wonder, as many have, why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 – or to find some accommodation with its critics today – is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics.
Negotiation, compromise, and accommodation are the marks of economic politics, where every deal has its price.
By contrast, those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate, for that would undermine the belief itself.
This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese – or, for that matter, that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West.
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics.
These things can change.
Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China.
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about.
Many non-Chinese, including me, have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo.
One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views.
But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
Until China is released from the grip of religious politics, Liu’s ideals are unlikely to take root.
This does not bode well for China, or, indeed, for the rest of the world.
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq, fears that the country's economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion; with that, worries about the health of the global economy are growing, too.
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy's growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come.
Can the situation get worse?
Yes, it can: much worse.
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time:
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan's misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor.
Today, these deficits set new records by the month;
America's appallingly low savings rate.
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed, this was understandable; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings, so why bother?
Today's savings rate, while it has increased slightly, still finds America at the bottom of the world's savings league tables;
lax accounting standards.
The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals didn't emerge out of thin air, but had their origins in the mid-1990s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters.
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today's excess capacity.
To this old brew, new ingredients have been added, notably the most rapid change in a nation's fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen.
In a "now you see it, now you don't" move only a magician should love, the $3 trillion, ten year (non social security) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gapingdeficit of $2 trillion dollars.
Of course, excuses are at hand: the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold.
Excuses, excuses.
As the old saying goes: Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens, it sold them forward!
To anyone with decent eyesight, it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense.
Clear, too, was the fact that, in promoting its tax cuts, the Bush Administration was engaging (on a multi-billion dollar scale) in dishonest, Enron-like accounting.
So if things are so bad now, how can they get worse?
Here's a plausible scenario.
To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day.
When America was the only safe haven for global investors, this was easy.
But America today appears less safe.
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts, lack of confidence in America's economic policy management (compounded by the mounting deficits), and America's soft underlying economic fundamentals, has dented the US economy's global reputation.
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect, the dollar will weaken.
As the dollar weakens, America looks even less safe.
So a rush to the door begins.
While a weak dollar may be good for exports, a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence.
Eventually, even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement, especially given Bush's proposed risky experiments with the social security system.
At that point, Americans will join the stampede out of their economy.
Why shouldn't they?
They're free to choose where to put their money.
Europe's stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative.
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe.
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports.
The European Central Bank, fixated on inflation, will be slow to lower interest rates, and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses.
Europe will join America in a downturn, reinforcing America's decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral.
I am not predicting that this will happen.
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy: a tax cut that might made minimal sense when itseemedthat the US had a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all.
The Bush Administration should admit this, and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means.
President Bush could even stabilize the economy, offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the downturn continues.
America is strong, and the global economy is strong.
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur, a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes.
Downturns, of course, can never be fully prevented.
We can, however, decrease their frequency; we can make them shallower; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected.
Sadly, we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences.
Last winter, America's central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back.
The Fed's cut in its basic interest rate to 1.75% per year seemed to have worked: the recession was ending.
Despite sobered expectations about the high-tech revolution's impact on productivity and profits, as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center, American businesses, it was believed, would soon start investing again big-time because borrowing money at 1.75% was too good a deal to pass up.
By late spring, those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen.
Suddenly, everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies.
Suddenly, everyone saw just how much America's system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990s.
The American stock market fell 15-20% below its winter levels.
Spreads between the interest rate at which America's government could borrow and the interest rates at which America's corporations could borrow widened.
Suddenly, the Fed stopped congratulating itself: a 1.75% interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow-Jones stock market index stands at 10,000, but not when the Dow-Jones index stands at 8,500.
Throughout the summer, corporate investment news remained disappointing.
More and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a "double dip" recession.
Yet throughout all this, the Federal Reserve remained passive.
The short-term interest rates it controlled didn't budge.
Only in mid-August did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut.
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts.
First, short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only.
They would thus have little effect on the longer-term rates that really drive business investment.
Second, short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets: if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts, the argument went, businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them.
The Fed's judgment appeared to be that it was largely (if not completely) powerless: it had done all that it could, and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity.
So the US in 2002 joined Japan in what economists have for sixty-five years called a Liquidity Trap: a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession.
America's situation was not unique: Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mid-1990s.
But there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain.
How long this state of affairs will last is unknown.
Nevertheless, even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap, and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon, this is a frightening situation.
If monetary policy is not effective, the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy: changes in the government's tax and spending plans to change the government's direct contribution to aggregate demand.
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex, baroque, eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy.
It simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy.
An America caught in a liquidity trap is, quite simply, a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management.
There have been two eras since World War II when policymakers - American policymakers, at least - believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy.
The first was the Keynesian high-water mark of confidence in demand management of the 1960s.
It was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oil-price shocks of the 1970s.
The second was the decade of successful business-cycle management by Alan Greenspan's independent, apolitical, and technocratic Fed during the 1990s.
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first.
Eighty years ago, John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-World War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was, and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated.
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle.
He would be shocked to look at today's world: a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment, a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation, and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news.
MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure, the eurozone’s crisis-hit countries are, at long last, bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets.
Salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level.
And yet, competitiveness in Greece and Portugal, in particular, is not improving.
The latest Eurostat figures on the evolution of the price index for self-produced goods (GDP deflator) show no tendency whatsoever in the crisis-stricken countries towards real devaluation.
But real devaluation, achieved by lowering prices vis-à-vis their eurozone competitors, is the only way to re-establish these countries’ competitiveness.
A reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions.
After all, it was price inflation in the crisis countries, fueled by massive inflows of cheap credit following the introduction of the euro, that resulted in their loss of competitiveness, ballooning current-account deficits, and accumulation of enormous foreign debt.
Now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits, prices should be going into reverse, but this, obviously, is not happening.
In 2010, inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors.
The latest Eurostat figures for the third quarter of 2011, however, are already showing a different picture: the price level in Portugal and Greece has remained practically unchanged over the course of the year, and in Italy and Spain it even rose slightly (by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively).
Only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation – as it has since the country’s real-estate bubble burst in 2006 – with a relative price decrease of 2.2%.
On the whole, Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of 15% over the course of the past five years.
This internal devaluation is paying off: while Ireland was still running a current-account deficit of 5.6% of GDP in 2008, the European Commission expects the outturn for 2011 to have been a 0.7%-of-GDP current-account surplus.
True, much of this is mere debt-service relief, given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with self-printed money, for which it pays only 1% interest.
However, Ireland’s big trade surplus did improve further.
Ireland owes much of this turnaround to its efficient export sector, whose supporters were able to enforce a political U-turn.
Greece, on the other hand, is under the influence of a strong import lobby.
As the Greek economics minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, has said, this is attributable to European Union subsidies, which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector.
Now these importers form a powerful bulwark against any policy that causes deflation, even though lowering prices – and thereby redirecting Greek demand from foreign to domestic products and helping tourism – is the only way to put the Greek economy back on its feet.
Since Greece’s current-account deficit as a share of GDP was three times higher than Ireland’s, Greek prices would have to fall by about half to achieve the same kind of success.
It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest, if not conditions approaching those of civil war.
But it isn’t just importers who are blocking real devaluation.
Unions, too, are resisting the necessary wage reductions, and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value, while their debts remain unchanged.
The situation is intractable.
Many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out.
This help has been given.
The recent agreement gave Greece relief of €237 billion ($316 billion), about 30% more than Greece’s net national income of roughly €180 billion euros.But such help only entrenches the wrong prices – and thus the economy’s lack of competitiveness.
The debts will re-emerge like a tumor, growing year by year, while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries.
If that happened, the euro would eventually collapse.
Only a price reduction would create current-account surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts.
It is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth.
Those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts.
In other words, they should take a kind of euro sabbatical – a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff.
After the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down, the sun would come out again very quickly.
The creditor countries would have to shoulder big losses from write-downs, but they would still end up with more than they would have gotten had the crisis countries remained within the eurozone, because these countries’ new prosperity, gained by leaving, offers the only chance of recovering any assets at all.
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union’s future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration.
To join in the EU’s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free.
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot – indeed, must not – be considered a stranger to its Union.
Today’s great Pax Europa and today’s pan-European prosperity depend on this.
Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer’s wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms.
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930’s, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970’s?
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland’s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague’s Velvet Revolution in 1989?
That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it.
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer.
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.Those who doubt Ukraine’s European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe’s past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe’s peace and Europe’s unity.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany – a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests.
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe’s peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast.
But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.
We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism – ideologies born in the heart of Europe – battled for mastery.
Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime’s corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime’s thugs.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine’s people prevailed.
So, despite today’s doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine’s history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism’s legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity.
When the EU’s citizens ponder Ukraine’s place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see.
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule.
Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year’s election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom “the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded.”
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union's future institutions, now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading.
Or at least, to consider perhaps a quite different question: where would it be reasonable for the EU to move?
Communism's fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well.
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence, and Yugoslavia's breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence, there is something tantalizing new in all this as well.
In the interwar years, the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical, artificial creations of the Great Powers.
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states.
Why was this?
Because 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace.
To be viable, a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market.
None of this holds true today.
With the prospect of entry into the EU, national markets matter less.
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable, and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members.
Lacking such external threats, the ties between, say, Czechs and Slovaks (to say nothing of Serbs and Croats!) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government.
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years.
After all, wasn't Italy, until 1860s, a collection of kingdoms and principalities?
Wasn't Germany's unification a matter of ``blood and iron''?
France and Spain are older, but is the marriage of Basques, Catalans, and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech/Slovak marriage?
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English?
Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity, patriotism, the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and think of this: why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government, between the common European framework and their local institutions?
Why do Piemontese, Bavarians, or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies, welfare programs, securities laws, and the largely useless, duplicative armies?
Wouldn't life be easier if a common market, currency, foreign policy, army, and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis, with the rest left to more meaningful local units?
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation.
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees, billions wasted in political patronage, and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40% of the economic product of Europe's nation states.
Could any common European state do worse?
Indeed, the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and society as a whole) in Europe's entire history.
Look at America in 1787: creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies, ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent.
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states.
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic.
If it were todisplace national governments, its burden would be weightless in comparison to what exists today.
Nations also put Europe's constitutional balance out of kilter.
Germany and Italy are simply too big, as compared to Portugal or Belgium (itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons), and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire.
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in ``Europe'' as they feel in their national states?
No, but must they?
When Europeans think of future institutions, the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity.
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions, but by adevolution of loyalties, and a revival of smaller, more meaningful, communities?
Of course, the demise of national states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens.
Indeed, national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions, clichés, like race, class, and other ideological creations.
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle.
But Europe's nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they arecenters of power.
After all, forty cents out of every euro of GDP is a lot to fight about.
If, however, Europeans gain a sense of where they should be going, perhaps in time the national identities forged in the last couple of hundred years (for they are not much older than that) will become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occasional inflammation.
NEW HAVEN – The global economy is in the midst of its second growth scare in less than two years.
Get used to it.
In a post-crisis world, these are the footprints of a failed recovery.
The reason is simple.
The typical business cycle has a natural cushioning mechanism that wards off unexpected blows.
The deeper the downturn, the more powerful the snapback, and the greater the cumulative forces of self-sustaining revival.
Vigorous V-shaped rebounds have a built-in resilience that allows them to shrug off shocks relatively easily.
But a post-crisis recovery is a very different animal.
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time is Different, over the long sweep of history, post-crisis recoveries in output and employment tend to be decidedly subpar.
Such weak recoveries, by definition, lack the cushion of V-shaped rebounds.
Consequently, external shocks quickly expose their vulnerability.
If the shocks are sharp enough – and if they hit a weakened global economy that is approaching its “stall speed” of around 3% annual growth – the relapse could turn into the dreaded double-dip recession.
That is the risk today.
There can be no mistaking the decidedly subpar character of the current global recovery.
Superficially, the numbers look strong: world GDP rebounded by 5.1% in 2010, and is expected to rise another 4.3% in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But because these gains follow the massive contraction that occurred during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, they are a far cry from the trajectory of a classic V-shaped recovery.
Indeed, if the IMF’s latest forecast proves correct, global GDP at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its longer-term 3.7% annual-growth path.
Even if the global economy holds at a 4.3% cruise speed – a big “if,” in my view – it will remain below its trend-line potential for over eight years in a row, through 2015.
This protracted “global output gap” underscores the absence of a cushion in today’s world economy, as well as its heightened sensitivity to shocks.
And there have certainly been numerous such blows in recent months – from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and Japan’s natural disasters to sharply higher oil prices and another setback in the US housing recovery.
While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to have derailed the current global recovery, the combined effect is worrisome, especially in a still-weakened post-crisis world.
Most pundits dismiss the possibility of a double-dip recession.
Labeling the current slowdown a temporary “soft patch,” they pin their optimism on the inevitable rebound that follows any shock.
For example, a boost is expected from Japan’s reconstruction and supply-chain resumption.
Another assist may come from America’s recent move to tap its strategic petroleum reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower.
But in the aftermath of the worst crisis and recession of modern times – when shocks can push an already weakened global economy to its tipping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario – the escape velocity of self-sustaining recovery is much harder to achieve.
The soft patch may be closer to a quagmire.
This conclusion should not be lost on high-flying emerging-market economies, especially in Asia – currently the world’s fastest-growing region and the leader of what many now call a two-speed world.
Yet with exports still close to a record 45% of pan-regional GDP, Asia can hardly afford to take external shocks lightly – especially if they hit an already weakened baseline growth trajectory in the post-crisis developed world.
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this very risk.
Policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth scares.
They continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting post-crisis healing.
That is certainly true of the United States.
While the US Federal Reserve Board’s first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a wrenching crisis, the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy.
America’s zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets, and US workers need to align new skills with new jobs.
Open-ended liquidity injections accomplish neither.
European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset.
Mistaking a solvency problem for a liquidity shortfall, Europe has become hooked on the drip feed of bailouts.
However, this works only if countries like Greece grow their way out of a debt trap or abrogate their deeply entrenched social contracts.
The odds on either are exceedingly poor.
The likelihood of recurring growth scares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policies.
Driven by short-term electoral horizons, policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix – another bailout or one more liquidity injection.
Yet, in the aftermath of a balance-sheet recession in the US, and in the midst of a debt trap in Europe, that approach is doomed to failure.
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose – to buy time. Yet time is not the answer for economies desperately in need of the structural repairs of fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, labor-market reforms, or improved competitiveness.
Nor does time cushion anemic post-crisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock.
It’s hard to know when the next shock will hit, or what form it will take; otherwise, it wouldn’t be a shock.
But, as night follows day, such a disruption is inevitable.
With policymakers reluctant to focus on the imperatives of structural healing, the result will be yet another growth scare – or worse.
A failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today’s post-crisis world.
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway.
At the same time, the Commission’s latest report on Turkey’s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down, further calling into question the country’s future EU membership.
The Commission’s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month.
At that meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?
Has the EU’s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey?
What are the EU’s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey?
If the answers to the first two questions are “no” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important.
True, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and this is a violation of agreements.
But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership.
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004.
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part.
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it.
Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part.
This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict.
It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU’s fairness?
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching, for they have clearly been spurred by Turks’ wish to move closer to the EU.
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction, towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state.
Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey’s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU’s behavior.
This leaves us with the third question: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU’s interest to see Turkey’s democracy and economy continue to strengthen.
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership, it will be welcome in the EU.
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously.
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership.
But they are reacting to the current situation.
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner – a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria (democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, and an effective market economy) – many more are inclined to say yes.
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.
First, they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans.
Second, they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations.
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors.
Here the Finns, who chair the EU right now, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict.
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.
At the same time, a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN’s proposals regarding Cyprus.
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it.
The agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come: how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases?
The G8 leaders agreed to seek “substantial” cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give “serious consideration” to the goal of halving such emissions by 2050 – an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets, least of all the United States, whose president, George W. Bush, will no longer be in office in 2009, when the tough decisions have to be made.
One could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all.
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 189 countries, including the US, China, India, and all the European nations, signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases “at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”
Fifteen years later, no country has done that.
US per capita greenhouse gas emissions, already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office, have continued to rise.
In March, a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade.
Now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago.
That’s a triumph?
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails, that will be easy enough.
In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits.
Now, in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change, Ma Kai, the head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets.
Likewise, the spokesman of India’s foreign minister, Navtej Sarna, has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions.
Are China and India being unreasonable?
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century.
That is true: most of those gases are still in the atmosphere, and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is.
China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did, unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions.
China, India, and other developing nations, have a point – or rather, three points.
First, if we apply the principle “You broke it, you fix it,” then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our “broken” atmosphere, which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world’s climate changing.
Second, even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem, it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese, and as much as 18 times more than the average Indian.
Third, the richer nations are better able than less well-off nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations.
But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases, they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations.
This year or next, China will overtake the US as the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – on a national, rather than a per capita basis, of course.
In 25 years, according to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China’s emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan combined.
But there is a solution that is both fair and practical:
Establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth’s average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous.
Divide that total by the world’s population, thus calculating what each person’s share of the total is.
Allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country’s population, multiplied by the per person share.
Finally, allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota.
The fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny.
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth’s atmosphere?
But, in addition to being fair, this scheme also has practical benefits.
It would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas, because if they can keep their per capita emissions low, they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations.
The rich countries will benefit, too, because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations.
In recent days, Italy’s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country’s troop deployment in Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
They are increasingly convinced that “victory” will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states, however powerful, and religiously driven armed insurgents.
Donald Rumsfeld’s dogma of military “transformation” – the technological upgrading of an army’s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed resoundingly in Iraq.
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980’s nor NATO’s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield.
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory.
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz’s notion of “decisive battles” as the “center of gravity” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “center of gravity.”
Indeed, while wars from the time of Hannibal’s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity, with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism.
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.
In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble.
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever.
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel’s border with Syria, India’s border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas.
In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict.
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.Indeed, such asymmetric conflicts through proxies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war.
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing. “Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war.
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict.
Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before.
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.
It is during the war after the war that the occupier’s inferiority is revealed, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield.
The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with their enemies’ technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years.
The Iraq war and Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution.
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity.
That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary.
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today’s asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.
MOSCOW – Twenty-five years ago this month, I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, Iceland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced, and could have ultimately eliminated by 2000, the fearsome arsenals of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union.
For all our differences, Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security.
Even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik, the summit was nonetheless, in the words of my former counterpart, “a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world.”
The next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized.
Critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best, and a risky utopian dream at worst.
They point to the Cold War’s “long peace” as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war.
As someone who has commanded these weapons, I strongly disagree.
Nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace.
By failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament, the US, Russia, and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used.
That catastrophe must be forestalled.


As I, along with George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and others, pointed out five years ago, nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nuclear-armed states increases.
Barring preemptive war (which has proven counterproductive) or effective sanctions (which have thus far proven insufficient), only sincere steps toward nuclear disarmament can furnish the mutual security needed to forge tough compromises on arms control and nonproliferation matters.
The trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties.
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty destroyed the feared quick-strike missiles then threatening Europe’s peace.
And, in 1991, the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) cut the bloated US and Soviet nuclear arsenals by 80% over a decade.
But prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament.
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous.
By linking an array of interrelated matters, Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear-arms race of which we had lost control.
In retrospect, the Cold War’s end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion.
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume “good faith” negotiations for disarmament.
This would augment the diplomatic and moral capital available to diplomats as they strive to restrain nuclear proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the wherewithal to construct a nuclear bomb.
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine.
We can no longer afford, politically or financially, the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear “haves” and “have-nots.”
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded.
Conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 1986.
Before I became Soviet leader in 1985, relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom.
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction.
What seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order.
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action.
Why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today?
A first step would be for the US finally to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war.
It’s time for Obama to make good on commitments he made in Prague in 2009, take up Reagan’s mantle as Great Communicator, and persuade the US Senate to formalize America’s adherence to the CTBT.
This would compel the remaining holdouts – China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan – to reconsider the CTBT as well.
That would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment – the atmosphere, undersea, in outer space, or underground.
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to follow up on the New START agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts, especially tactical and reserve weapons, which serve no purpose, waste funds, and threaten security.
This step must be related to limits on missile defense, one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit.
A fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT), long stalled in multilateral talks in Geneva, and a successful second Nuclear Security Summit next year in Seoul, will help secure dangerous nuclear materials.
This will also require that the 2002 Global Partnership, dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, chemical, and biological – is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US.
Our world remains too militarized.
In today’s economic climate, nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits.
If, as seems likely, economic troubles continue, the US, Russia, and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the UN Conference on Disarmament.
These deliberations would yield greater security for less money.
But the buildup of conventional military forces – driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US – must be addressed as well.
As we engage in furthering our Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement, we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally.
US President John F. Kennedy once warned that “every man, woman, and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment.”
For more than 50 years, humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords.
The example of Reykjavik should remind us that palliative measures are not enough.
Our efforts 25 years ago can be vindicated only when the Bomb ends up beside the slave trader’s manacles and the Great War’s mustard gas in the museum of bygone savagery.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "Revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.
If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "eventually" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal.
This year’s Cup, unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002, didn’t witness any real upsets in the first round.
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round, and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat, with only Ghana advancing.
There have been just two ugly matches so far, full of fouls, nasty attacks, and unnecessary aggression, as well as numerous yellow and red cards: Italy vs. the US, and Portugal vs. the Netherlands.
Otherwise, we’re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany, in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere.
As for Germany and the Germans, one hardly recognizes one’s own country and people.
Even Mother Nature has played along.
After a long winter and a non-existent spring, summer started promptly with the first kick-off – and virtually overnight, Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side.
The weather is Mediterranean, and all of a sudden, so are the people.
The Cup’s organization has been exceptional (as was to be expected), with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance.
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world (which was not expected).
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer (which nobody could have expected!).
More importantly, not only in the German team, but also in the country as a whole, a young, cool, laid-back, and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan, friendly, and good-humored.
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.
Doctors are on strike, taxes are on the rise, the parties in government are mauling each other, and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape.
But the Germans, undaunted by it all, simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world.
The black, red, and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before, but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones.
In fact, the flags of many nations fly alongside German.
In Berlin, as in other large German cities, taxis sport the flags of their drivers’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia.
Fans don not just their nations’ flags, but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries’ colors.
Flags are flown in hope of victory, but also serve to dry the tears of defeat.
In short, Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night’s dream, with a touch of Woodstock to boot.
Outside the stadiums, public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “happenings.”
And how is the soccer?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone.
First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer.
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity.
Second, international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation.
Spain, Argentina, and Germany, to name but a few countries, have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game.
On the French, English, and Portuguese teams, too, it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane, Beckham, and Figo.
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002.
This generational change is accelerated by a third development.
At the top international level, soccer has become faster and more athletic, and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively.
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 (or more) minutes, switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team, and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents' movements won’t stand much of a chance.
Here, soccer parallels today’s globalized markets, which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary.
Unlike economic globalization, however, it remains to be seen whether this new, fast-paced style of soccer will prevail (after all, the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France).
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does.
For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch.
Let’s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9, we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible.
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism, because, unfortunately, two universal principles will continue to apply in the future: first, the winter will return, and, second, the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult.
Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991.
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq. ``Yes, I know,'' I said. ``I've been watching the bombardment on TV.''
Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq.
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US, now Poland's NATO ally.
Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq's occupation.
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism's collapse in 1989!
Little of this, however, is the result of design, for (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union.
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us.
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing'' we influence Europe's fate; others suffer crippling pessimism, consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class'' status--and you have a recipe for inertia.
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out.
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset: we say that we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges.
Then we squabble about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO, membership in the Alliance didn't really require debate.
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was theonlyreal option.
EU membership and the global war on terror, however, demand a more deeply considered response.
Why?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy, and society, while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy.
Today's crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's ``New Europe,'' means that Poland (like every other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO.
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests, as well what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new'' and ``old'' Europe, as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds.
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Instead, the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see new players (say, Spain) rising to shape EU policy, particularly foreign policy, and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged.
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades.
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse.''
Instead, the EU's structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe's role in the world, but also new means to achieve consensus.
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power.
The world needs a united continent, ready to go into action.
That consensus must include the US.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power.
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era.
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic, and its belief that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won't spend the money necessary to achieve that goal.
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security.
The US is, but security does not come free of charge.''
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
Indeed, all of Europe is in thrall to American power.
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear.
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
help poor countries.
Polish foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives.
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations, in an expanded Union, and in relations between the ``New'' and ``Old'' Europe.
BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year: governments, he said, are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure.
Summers was criticizing Europe’s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU’s north and south, and between reckless banks’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day.
But, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel smug.
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States, where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America’s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis.
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively, on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25% per year.
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two.
In that case, the $500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $1 trillion of extra output of goods and services, generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment, and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years.
And, with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs, the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future.
The impressive gains don’t stop there.
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $20 billion a year of income and social welfare.
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $20 billion a year in higher production.
And half of the extra $1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households.
In sum, on the benefits side of the equation: more jobs now, $500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and then a $40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter.
So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?
For starters, the $500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity.
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion.
The $40 billion a year of higher economic activity would, however, generate roughly $10 billion a year in additional tax revenue.
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due, the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt.
In other words, taxpayers win, because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt, enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates.
Households win, too, because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes.
Companies win, because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure.
The unemployed win, because some of them get jobs.
And even bond investors win, because they get their money back, with the interest for which they contracted.
So what is not to like?
Nothing.
How, you might ask, can I say this?
I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science, in which there are no free lunches, in which benefits are always balanced by costs, and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are.
But there are two things different about today.
First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole.
Second, bond investors are being really stupid.
In a world in which the S&amp;P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year.
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors’ extraordinary and irrational panic.
They are willing to pay 6% per year for “safety.”
Right now, however, the US government can manufacture “safety” out of thin air merely by printing bonds.
The government, too, would then win by pocketing that 6% per year of value – though 30 years from now, bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy.
NEW YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort.
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum, gas, and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges.
France, at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year, is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move.
With French leadership, 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear, precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities.
Oil, gas, and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies.
Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
Yet, despite great natural wealth, a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty.
The actual taxes and payments made by mining, oil, and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret, even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good.
In reality, in far too many countries, ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money; in fact, they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations.
Indeed, these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions.
Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East.
In these countries, many of which are rich in oil and gas, citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression.
At bottom, they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world’s energy supplies.
Transparency is an essential part of the solution.
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms, as well as mining companies, publish all of their relevant financial information, broken down by country and by project, and including all payments made to host-country public budgets.
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges, this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located.
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular, timely basis, and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies.
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments, through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
That law’s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90% of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies.
This will help citizens track how that money is used, but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share.
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers, financial and accounting balances, and payments to authorities, companies would become truly accountable to citizens, and government revenues would be augmented.
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission, and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance, integrity, and transparency in economic transactions.”
At its just-completed summit in Deauville, France, the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil, gas, and mining companies.
This is an important advance, but, unfortunately, it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative, and it focuses only on payments transparency.
Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed, given that important emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China, as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries, will be at the table.
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone.
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives, economies, and political systems around the world.
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “a week is a long time in politics.”
So, in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election, any prediction made today could be reversed, and reversed again, before the vote.
But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left.
In fact, they have more in common than meets the eye, for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity.
For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices.
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac‘s presidency, together with France’s tradition of alternation in power, suggests a victory for the left.
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today’s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate.
This is reflected in Sarkozy’s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high.
Sarkozy’s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America’s military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was disastrously wrong.
Thus, his deep admiration for “American values,” while sincere, implies no embrace of President George W. Bush.
It also reassures the French business community, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin’s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac’s foreign minister.
At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, may have lost politically to de Gaulle, but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “false values.”
By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign.
In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible.
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic.
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her “essence,” thereby countering Sarkozy’s stress on his record as a “doer.”
Her appeal to voters is simple: “I am a woman, and you have never tried a woman, so be modern and try one now.”
Hiding behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender, Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”
Thus, Royal’s program is her popularity.
In foreign policy, one can only guess what her priorities would be.
As far as Europe is concerned, she seems as “agnostic” as Sarkozy, who, like her, incarnates a new generation of “post-European” leaders.
In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family.
According to public opinion polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy.
Her support is particularly strong among women voters.
For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal.
In the opinion of Royal’s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants, the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity: the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern.
According to Royal’s Socialist critics, the “Hollywoodization” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead.
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.
Moreover, both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac’s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture.
Royal openly claims Mitterand’s legacy as she searches for legitimacy, while Sarkozy’s rejection of Chirac’s legacy has more to do with form than substance.
To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations, as it did in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
As in 2002, the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less.
But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs.
As Europe’s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new, slimmed down, Reform Treaty, it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place.
Let’s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges, especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building.
On top of that, let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at “Year Zero” means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on, the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies.
Let’s suspend our disbelief, then, and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last.
Or, to put it another way, let’s look at our problems in the light of the EU’s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies, and then let’s ask ourselves why the EU isn’t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods.
Broadly, we see three areas in which Europe’s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better: global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership, the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide, and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU’s own political machinery.
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda.
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals, and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful.
On conflict and security issues, Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma’s military regime.
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage, rather than as a “broad church” in which different viewpoints co-exist.
The aim should be that “soft power” instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with.
That means, of course, that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10% of the total population.
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU’s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy.
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well, which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU’s policy responses so far.
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities.
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make, so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world’s poorest countries.
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders.
Agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe’s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest.
It won’t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe, but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price.
By much the same token, Europe’s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans’ sense of a shared history and common values.
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable.
Meanwhile, doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals.
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union’s decision-making mechanisms, but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
We believe, though, that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself.
That way, if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty, it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty, was in 2005.
Coral reefs are the world's most biologically rich marine ecosystems, harboring some of the world's most beautiful organisms.
They provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide.
Reef-based activities (principally fishing and tourism) form the economic livelihood of millions more.
Clearly, the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous.
Yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing.
Wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places, and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk.
But there is some good news, too: we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs' ``resilience''-- their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem.
We must mediate the severity of global warming, while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs.
Historically, the principal agents of reef degradation have been over-fishing and pollution, not global warming.
In healthy ecosystems, when prey numbers decline, predators become malnourished, and their numbers decline, too, giving their prey a chance to recover.
But human predators are different.
When our prey numbers decline, their economic value tends to increase, so fishing intensifies.
This means that once predator species become depleted, fishing pressure shifts towards plant-eating fish species, leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs.
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs.
When coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones, diseases, and other disturbances, it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check, and allow coral populations to recover.
Without them, fast-growing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef, preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover.
Because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend, the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reef's biodiversity.
Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations' ability to recover, giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge.
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant.
The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant; the plant converts sunlight into energy, which it shares with the animal.
For reasons that are not yet fully understood, this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures.
The plant is expelled, and corals turn a brilliant white color.
If temperatures soon return to normal, the partnership can be restored.
But if corals remain ``bleached'' for too long, they die.
For many species of coral, this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location.
Interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios, this is disturbing news.
If coral bleaching thresholds remain steady, local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades.
Corals grow slowly, so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again.
Fortunately, there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve.
Most coral species have broad geographical distributions, and bleach at different temperatures depending on location.
Many species that bleach at 28o or 29o centigrade on Australia's Great Barrier Reef routinely tolerate temperatures of 34o or more in the Arabian Sea.
Unfortunately, we do not know how long it takes for such adaptation to occur.
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs.
The first is obvious: minimize global warming by, say, honoring the Kyoto Treaty's emissions targets.
Second, we must restore coral reefs' capacity to cope with environmental change--their resilience--by protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check, and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching.
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread.
Without fish, seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery.
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world--on coral reefs and elsewhere--has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries.
Many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones.
So there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of ``no-take zones''--areas in which fishing is prohibited altogether.
As fish populations in these no-take zones recover, they create ``spill-over'' effects, with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones.
More importantly, they provide a refuge for fish populations, a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse.
On coral reefs, these no-take zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community, and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings.
Scientific evidence indicates that, to be effective, 30-50% of available habitat should be set aside as no-take zones.
This figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs, the US and Australia, where current levels of protection are less than 5%.
Given the magnitude of the threat to the world's coral reefs, the international community's response has been frighteningly slow.
But there is some encouraging news: in June, Australia's government proposed a major increase in no-take areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 30%.
If adopted, this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit.
The future of tropical marine ecosystems, and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them, depend on it.
GAZA – This was supposed to be my first year of medical school.
Instead, I am stuck here in Gaza, in my father’s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp, with few options and no way out.
After I finished high school last year, I decided to become a doctor.
Gaza cries out for bone specialists, but the training I need is available only abroad. 
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany, my parents were proud.
I was excited to follow my older brother, who is already studying there.
In February, the German authorities granted me an entrance visa.
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe.
But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out – not students.
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad.
For many of us, this is our only opportunity to continue our education.
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide.
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures, like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery. 
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few post-graduate programs.
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza.
Without the ability to go overseas, we cannot learn.
In June, after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “recognized” scholarships – but not “hundreds.”
So hundreds of us are still waiting, most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world’s attention.
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owns a children’s clothing shop.
My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had been working as a teacher.
That was at the height of the peace process.
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993, and decided that they could give us a better life here.
But when I was ten, the secondintifada began.
The peace process was collapsing throughout my teenage years.
During my third year of high school, the Israeli authorities closed off the Gaza Strip.
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle, and have suffocated Gaza’s economy, choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity.
There is no clothing left in my father’s shop, which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies.
With the backing of the US, Canada, and the European Union, Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas, which won the elections here in 2006.
But the blockade only makes people more desperate.
Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip, including Jabalia.
Israel’s blockade amounts to collective punishment.
It is hurting all of us, whether we support Hamas or not.
It is also destroying my dream to write “Specialist in Bone Medicine” after my name.
Sometimes, I am sorry that I am from Gaza.
But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills, and return to help others here.
Sometimes, when there is electricity, I watch television and see how people live in other places.
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel, to study, to take vacations, when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds?
Soon, my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes.
When they do, I will probably still be here in my father’s house, waiting for the blockade to end.
BUCHAREST: As Chile’s former dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, under house arrest outside of London, awaits a final decision on whether he is to be extradited to Spain to face charges of having committed crimes against humanity, Romania has tried and convicted one of its own military leaders for his role in the massacre of civilians in the city of Timisoara ten years ago.
The confused reaction to this verdict should, perhaps, give pause to all those who think that putting the past on trial is a straightforward thing.
Generals Atanase Stanculescu and Mihai Chitac were found guilty of ordering the killings of dozens of innocent people in Timisoara in 1989.
Both were sentenced each to long prison terms.
The rulings were met with fierce criticism by some journalists and politicians but were enthusiastically welcomed by others.
Undoubtedly, these verdicts will remain divisive in a society not yet able to come to terms with its past.
The story of General Stanculescu, sentenced to 15 years in prison, reads like a cheap novel, with treason thrown into the mix.
The tall, good-looking officer was among Nicolae Ceausescu’s closest aides.
As the uprising against the Ceausescu regime broke out in December 1989 in Timisoara, Stanculescu (together with General Chitac) was dispatched to the city and ordered to suppress all demonstrations by any available means.
He carried out these orders ruthlessly, his troops shooting down over 100 unarmed street demonstrators.
Summoned back to Bucharest two days later, Stanculescu apparently had second thoughts about his loyalty to the dictator.
He recognized that Ceausescu was doomed. Pretending to have a broken leg, he stalled in making his reappearance.
Then, on the 22 December, as crowds stormed the Central Committee headquarters in Bucharest, Stanculescu arranged for a helicopter to rescue Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu from the building’s roof terrace.
Minutes before the helicopter took off, Elena told the General, who was wearing a fake plaster cast around his leg: “Dearest Victor, look after my children!”
By then, however, the General had turned coats: he had joined "the people" and the newly-born National Salvation Front.
The helicopter was taking the dictator and his wife to prison, not freedom.
Within days, Stanculescu was among those masterminding the show-trial of the Ceausescus which ended with their being sentenced to death and executed on the spot.
Film of Stanculescu at the time show that he had dispensed with his plaster cast.
Stanculescu’s career boomed.
He was appointed industry minister by the new, revolutionary government.
A few months later, he supported a group of young officers who called for army reform and the ouster of General Militaru, the then Defense Minister and a suspected KGB agent.
Militaru was sacked, but when Stanculescu became minister he cashiered the young officers who had helped him.
Reform of the army was put off.
One year later Stanculescu gave up politics and government altogether.
He set up a highly profitable arms trading company. Soon he became one of the country's richest tycoons.
Now, it seems that the tide has turned against him.
But has it?
General Stanculescu has appealed to the Supreme Court to quash his conviction.
A big part of public opinion seems to be behind him, believing his trial politically motivated.
Of course, many people and especially those who took to the streets against Ceausescu in 1989 feel vindicated his conviction.
But many politicians defend Stanculescu; among them, the current Defense Minister Victor Babiuc, former President Ion Iliescu, and most top army officers.
In the wake of the Stanculescu conviction, the Interior Minister reiterated his proposal for a general amnesty for all soldiers involved in the violence of 1989.
Supporters of this view argue that General Stanculescu, unlike President Pinochet, was carrying out orders he could not refuse. Later, they add, he voluntarily joined the "Revolution", fought its enemies and contributed to its victory.
Many Romanian Army officers are unhappy with the notion of soldiers being tried for crimes committed while defending the dying communist regime.
Yet, this is what every one of Romania’s post-revolutionary governments have promised at one time or another.
But these officers (and those who share their views) believe that you cannot assess the deeds of one regime by the standards of another.
Again as in Chile, they suggest that, while political regimes are transient, the heart and honor of a nation always rests with its Army. A soldier has a duty just to carry out the orders of his chiefs, no matter who they are and no matter what orders they give.
Stanculescu did just that in 1989 at Timisoara, and he did so again, a few days later, at Ceausescu’s trial.
These officers dismiss and mistrust the requirements of universal justice, as embodied in the Nuremberg rulings.
Because democratic institutions in Romania have frittered away much of their standing during the almost ten years of postcommunist transition, many politicians tend either to embrace the views of the generals, or, at least, avoid going publicly against them.
After all, opinion polls reveal that the Army and Orthodox Church – two hierarchical and traditional organizations – are, by far, the most trusted Romanian institutions.
Time and again, people seek to learn the truth about Romania’s past.
But, as that past becomes unearthed and its crimes exposed, many recoil from the consequences. The "original sin" of the Romanian Revolution always looms: most postcommunist institutions were created and later run by people deeply involved in the crimes of the communist regime.
Of course, people, at first, love seeing the truth uncovered and powerful wrongdoers punished.
But many would like to see all this while watching TV rather than experience it in real life.
Romania will have to decide whether or not it actually wants to have a past before its people can begin to confront and live with theirs.
Few concepts are as elastic as that of ``Conservatism.''
At one end of its spectrum of meanings, conservatism has (over the last two decades) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab.
At the other end, conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism.
In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic's failures, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives.
This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian-Social Union (CSU), who focus on moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, and on commanding Germany's political center.
With federal elections due in Germany this autumn, much will be said about the nature of German conservatism.
Some, looking at CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber's emphasis on Bavaria's economic success, will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the ``anything goes'' market conservatism practiced in America.
Others, pointing to the German conservatives' emphasis on social values, will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats.
The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons, which also makes it more durable.
CDU/CSU policies are, of course, founded on the idea of individual freedom, but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition.
We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man's sins, but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany's 20th century history.
Yet, despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature, we embrace humanity's talent for progress and innovation, because we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors.
These two traits, although they seem to conflict, and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires.
Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way, German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state, the market, and the individual.
We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts, such as those that exist between freedom and security.
Each, indeed, is unsustainable without the other.
Security is useless without freedom, but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security.
The social market economy, which we continue to embrace, is based on these principles.
It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth, but also embraces state interference, when necessary, to secure equality of opportunity, social solidarity, and social balance.
This interference is also intended to help avoid the ``economization'' of all aspects of civic life.
The market is merely a tool, not an answer to every human problem.
It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive, for example, to strike a balance between economy and ecology.
We feel responsible, on a global level, for the environment, which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world.
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity.
As we open ourselves to the wind's of globalization, we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity, such as the family, local and regional communities, religious communities, and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years.
This is the principle of ``subsidiarity'' which supports placing decision-making power, wherever and whenever possible, in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen.
This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union, where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe.
For German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warring concepts, as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others.
They are, instead, two sides of the same coin.
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation.
Decades later, the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations, as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations, because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure.
In essence, the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept.
Indeed, only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance, and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy.
In a fast changing world, this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike.
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future.
Moderation, tolerance, and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today's German conservatism.
In 2004, the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1%, the fastest pace in the last 28 years.
While Ifo`s World Economic Climate indicator, generated from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, worsened slightly during the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the boom.
In 2005, growth is estimated to have been about 4.3%, and a similar rate can be expected in 2006, marking a period of sustained rapid global growth unseen since the 1970’s.
But the boom is not uniform.
In the United States, the number of experts giving a favorable assessment of the current situation declined; indeed, a majority believes that the economic situation will worsen during the next six months.
However, in the Asian countries, including China, the optimism is unbroken.
The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America.
The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world.
Whereas growth was a miserable 1.5% in 2005 in the 15 “old” members of the European Union, Ifo expects EU-15 growth to accelerate to 2.1% in 2006.
To be sure, economic performance will vary widely among EU countries.
While Italy will be the laggard, with only 1.1% growth, the Irish rocket will not lose its force, pushing real GDP up by about 4.8%.
In general, the big EU countries are still performing badly, in contrast to the smaller members – hardly surprising, given that the EU is basically an institution to help the smaller countries overcome the drawback of their size by extending the agglomeration advantages that formerly were reserved to the bigger countries.
But even Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is experiencing an upswing.
The Ifo climate indicator for Germany, based on monthly surveys of 7,000 firms, jumped upwards in the second half of 2005, reaching its highest value since the boom year 2000, with businesses’ assessment of the current situation and expectations improving.
After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally on the move.
The driving force is external demand, as Germany, the world’s second-largest exporter, profits from the global boom.
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
However, as we saw in 2004 and 2005, exports are not enough to create substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow.
The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now growing, too.
While the second half of 2005 was already quite good, Ifo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6% in 2006.
After many years of contraction, investment in construction also will rise slightly.
Total investment growth is expected to reach 2.9% – weak by past standards, but nonetheless a promising salve for the wounded German mood.
Moreover, any investment growth is vital for Germany, which, according to the latest OECD statistics, currently suffers from the world’s lowest share of net investment in national income.
Even if Germany remains the world’s laggard, rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth, which Ifo estimates at 1.7% in 2006.
That number looks small compared to most other countries.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
But everything is relative: Germany’s trend growth rate is just 1.1%, and the country has been the slowest growing EU country since 1995.
Measured against a disappointing past, even Germany is currently experiencing an economic boom.
Indeed, even German unemployment, which has been rising in cycles since 1970, will decline slightly in 2006, from 4.8 to 4.7 million.
The good economic data will reinforce initial favorable impressions of Angela Merkel’s new government, which got off to an excellent start at the EU Summit, where Merkel helped to broker a compromise between Britain and France on the Union’s 2007-2013 budget (by adding another €2 billion to Germany’s annual contribution).
In fact, the government may even have contributed a bit to the good economic data by announcing a serious effort to consolidate Germany’s own public finances – a prerequisite for investor confidence.
According to the government, substantial tax increases will bring the fiscal deficit below the 3%-of-GDP limit set by the Stability and Growth Pact – a target missed for five consecutive years – by 2007.
The real test for the German government is the labor market.
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American earned-income tax credit.
In Germany, it’s called “activating social aid” or “combi wages,” but the principle is the same: the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force.
That would widen the wage distribution, create jobs, and maintain the living standard of the poor.
Merkel announced in her inaugural speech in the Bundestag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006.
If this is more than lip service, and if she really carries out a serious reform of the German welfare state’s incentive structure, the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth.
In the long term, that would be more promising for the EU – and for the global economy – than the demand-driven performance that Germany is currently enjoying.
NEW YORK – Late next month, a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth. We will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born.
We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic.
The world’s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945.
And our numbers keep growing, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food, and water. The global economy is generating pressures as well: rising joblessness, widening social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers.
These trends link the fate and future of today’s seven billion people as never before. No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century. International cooperation is a universal need.

The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity’s long-term imperatives.
At a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges, we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice.
To help create this future, I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives – five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today.

The first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development. We all must understand that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security, and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

In the next five years, we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement.
Fostering economic growth, realizing the Millennium Development Goals, and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet.
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.
This year, the UN peacekeeping budget will total $8 billion. Think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deploying political mediation missions, for example, rather than troops.
We know how to do this.
Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan.
A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world. In this effort, we must be courageous in standing up for democracy, human rights, and peace.
This year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in Côte d’Ivoire, Darfur, Egypt, and elsewhere. But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace.  
In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate.
Palestinians deserve a state.
Israel needs security.
Both want peace. A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace.
So, too, will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sierra Leone. And, in the name of all of humanity, we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.
This year’s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.
In Libya, we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country’s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order, consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
Syria is a special concern.
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression.
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people.
It has not done so.
The moment to act is now.
The violence must stop.
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.  
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world’s unrealized potential.
We need their full engagement – in government, business, and civil society.
The UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year, for the first time, UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world.
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world’s great global challenges.
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations.
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause.
Let our common agenda begin.
Mention the United Nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his tenure.
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations.
Reform is in the air – in part because of the scandal, but also because of the UN’s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and, most recently, Sudan.
Even the UN’s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security.
Some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council’s composition.
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run.
This helps to explain why a much-weakened France was made a permanent member of the Council – and why Germany and Japan (and a not-yet independent India) were not.
Defending the Security Council’s current make-up is impossible; the need for change is beyond debate.
But coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult.
Great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat, while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe’s relative over-representation.
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council; Argentina, Chile, and Mexico to adding Brazil; Nigeria to South Africa (and vice-versa); and several countries, including China, Indonesia, and South Korea, might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan.
Clearly, fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort.
In the meantime, there is important work to be done.
One productive avenue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the High Level Panel that was endorsed by Annan; namely, that all UN members go on record declaring that terrorism has no place in today’s world.
This will prove more difficult than it first sounds.
For too long, the international community has tolerated terrorism – the intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants by non-state actors for political purposes – on the grounds that, on occasion, “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past.
We do not.
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated, much less supported.
Weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons – are just that, and no cause can excuse their use.
Moreover, as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed, weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern, global life.
Terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims.
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American, Russian, European, and UN assistance.
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution.
No one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group’s only option.
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.
A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking, the hijacking of civilian aircraft, and terrorism more broadly.
Similarly, the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force, created in 1989 to curb money laundering, has grown and become focused mainly on curbing terrorist financing.
UN Security Council Resolution 1373, passed after the September 11 attacks, calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists, bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism, suppress recruitment by terrorist groups, block terrorists’ efforts to acquire weapons, and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspects and boosting security.
What is missing is a new, 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not.
Broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable, and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished.
Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism.
But ideas matter.
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.
Doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out.
We are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means.
It is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost.
NAIROBI – With unemployment soaring, bankruptcies climbing, and stock markets in free-fall, it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold.
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions.
Far from burdening an already over-stressed, over-stretched global economy, environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books flowing, and assist in powering economies back to health.
In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity – a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet.
A big slice of President Barack Obama’s $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy, “weatherizing” a million homes, and upgrading the country’s inefficient electricity grid.
Such investments could generate an estimated five million “green-collar” jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times.
President Lee Myung-Bak’s government plans to invest $38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities.
Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills.
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.
Similar pro-employment “Green New Deal” packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs, fighting poverty, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports.
In South Africa, the government-backedWorking for Water initiative – which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, youth, and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis.
The country spends roughly $60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, important tourism destinations, and farmland.
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.
As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country’s electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs.
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world’s leading economists at the UN’s headquarters in New York.
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.
Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes, together with the trillions of investors’ dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss.
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children’s future.
Instead, political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and encourage new patterns of decent, long-lasting employment.
CAMBRIDGE: The rich countries meeting in June at the G-7 Economic Summit in Cologne had some interesting things to declare about their relations with the poor countries.
First, they acknowledged -- without ever quite admitting it -- that their earlier attempts to reduce developing-country debt had failed.
Therefore they signaled the start of a new program, immediately dubbed the Cologne Initiative, to reduce further the debt burden of the so-called Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs).
Second, they instructed the IMF and the World Bank to re-think their development strategies, in order to put more focus on social problems, particularly health and education.
One could of course be quite cynical about both announcements.
After all, it has been clear to most objective observers for many years that the rich countries had no realistic strategy for reducing the unpayable debts of the poor countries, yet such critics were told to be patient, that everything was okay.
Moreover, only the finance ministers of the G-7 could possibly have believed that the IMF and World Bank were doing a good job in the poorest countries.
In truth, their record is often disastrous, or simply irrelevant.
The IMF in particular doesn't have a strategy for long-term economic development, even though the United States has assigned the IMF the lead role in economic development in dozens of poor countries.
Another reason for cynicism is that the G-7 didn't move mainly on their own initiative, but rather in response to a growing cry of international civil society for action on behalf of the world's poorest.
The credit for the Cologne Initiative goes strongly to the worldwide movement known as Jubilee 2000, a grass-roots movement based on the biblical concept of Jubilee, in which unpayable debts should be forgiven in order to allow a debtor to have a fresh start in life.
The Jubilee 2000 movement has adherents in all parts of the world, including Pope John Paul II, rock stars such as Bono of the Irish group U2, and non-governmental organizations representing many religions and professions.
We should move beyond cynicism, however, in embracing the new Cologne Initiative, especially to push the G-7 countries to do all that needs to be done to make the Initiative successful.
The details of the Initiative announced in Cologne were disappointing, but these details can still be changed under international public pressure.
At least the Initiative pointed in the right direction.
The motivation for urgent action on behalf of the poorest nations is clear.
The 42 countries that are part of the HIPC initiative have a combined population of around 700 million.
Around three-fourths of these people live in Africa.
The combined HIPC population has a life expectancy of around 50 years, compared with 78 years in the rich countries.
Around one-third of the children are malnourished, and will consequently suffer a lifetime of physical and cognitive disabilities.
Many will never finish even primary school, or be able to play an effective role in modern society.
Diseases are rampant, including an AIDs epidemic that killed around 2 million people in Africa last year, and malaria, which took more than 1 million lives.
A successful Cologne Initiative would build on the following concepts.
First, the debts of the countries suffering from extreme poverty and illness would be forgiven entirely.
Around 25 countries out of the 42 HIPC countries probably need complete debt cancellation.
Second, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank, rather than the International Monetary Fund, should take the lead in helping these countries.
Both the UNDP and the World Bank would help to ensure that debt forgiveness opens the way to new and ambitious programs of social improvement -- with the focuses on health and education.
The UNDP should turn its annual Human Development Reports into concrete guidelines for social action, to help ensure that each impoverished country has the adequate resources to provide effective programs for children's vaccines, AIDS prevention, meals for impoverished children, improved access to clean water, and mother-and-infant medical care.
The UNDP should also have the task of coordinating the specialized agencies of the United Nations on behalf of the world's poorest, to ensure that key organizations such as United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have the access and financial resources to fulfill their missions.
The Cologne Summit announcements so far fall short of these objectives.
The debt relief proposals are still too small.
The role of the IMF remains too large.
Public health goals are still too far down the list of priorities.
But we should maintain hope and pressure on the international organizations and the rich countries.
Already, international actions have pushed the G-7 in a new and hopeful direction.
With a continued worldwide movement on behalf of global justice and economic development, a much more ambitious program for the world's poorest can still be reached.
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents’ tables doesn’t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone.
That may sound obvious, but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating.
For example, Italian politicians, who, given Italy’s recent dismal economic performance, would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy, are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts.
Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain “if someone is pushing on the brake pedal.”
Who’s he kidding?
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy.
More than the usual “blame game” is at work here.
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates – and Berlusconi and Co.’s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy.
Soaring energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk.
But higher energy prices, by themselves, will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger.
The key will be so-called “second-round effects” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions.
So far, the “social partners,” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have been quiet.
Should this change, the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe’s economic growth remains slack.
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up (even in Italy).
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3% year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging.
How will the ECB react to better economic news?
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years).
True, there is no inflation problem in the short run, but the ECB’s monetary policy focuses on the medium term.
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB’s benchmark level, indicating an excess supply of liquidity.
It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question.
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB’s Governing Council.
This will change, however, once the economic pick-up is confirmed.
Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy.
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats’ candidate, is a reformer, holding out hope for Germany’s future – and that of Europe.
Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.
This would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes.
Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, companies might hold off on investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even less clear than it is now.
On the other hand, a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action.
This raises an interesting point.
The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates, because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way, and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed.
A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening.
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth.
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi, who have failed to put bread on the table, their minions in the media, and Keynesian economic professors who don’t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view.
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth.
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie.
Though Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel’s old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to conduct business with America’s blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980’s, through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
It was during Yitzhak Rabin’s government in the early 1990’s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment after America’s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accords, Israel’s peace agreement with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel’s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran’s worst nightmare.
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran, two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East, chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms.
The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire, and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians.
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such, the Mullahs’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran’s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy, for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to be concerned, for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel’s own strategy of “nuclear ambiguity” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region.
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way.
A military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is too dangerous, and its results uncertain.
And, however severe economic sanctions might be, they might not bring Iran to its knees.
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon.
However, being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US, not Iran, that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference.
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan.
And, when US forces overran Saddam Hussein’s army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But, neo-conservative haughtiness – “We don’t speak to evil” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran’s demarche.
Iran’s mood changed by the time America’s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse.
This would not be achieved, however, through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America’s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran’s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran’s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures, which are far lower than those of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power.
There is no better way to undercut Iran’s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investments in human development, and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel.
CAMBRIDGE – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today’s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious.
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union, which can lead only through constitutional change, the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
That may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized.
And, if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation.
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.
Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?
First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered.
Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro’s strength, the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee, just as private investors would, only in a faster and more concentrated way.
Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s.
True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.
Whereas the US Congress’s “supercommittee,” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package, will likely come up with a proposal, it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year.
Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar.
Fifth, the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis.&#160; An exchange rate of $1.4:€1 is cheap for Germany’s export powerhouse, which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro.
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis, wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards, even as productivity has remained stagnant.
But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range.
Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed.
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon.
So, yes, there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro, despite its drawn-out crisis, has remained so firm against the dollar so far.
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to cope with Greece’s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country’s debt burden.
In essence, this is a back-door debt restructuring: Europe’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default.
A recurrent characteristic of Europe’s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980’s.
Bolivia’s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt, an operation funded by international donors, is a classic example.
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign (debt repudiation was part of his platform), and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons invoked by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange) were beside the point.
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back at a discount through the back door.
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “vulture” investors.
To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned.
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands, and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff, the operation was a success.
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the market response.
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields, it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador’s behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices, could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange.
This is particularly notable, given that Ecuador’s was perhaps the first opportunistic default (triggered by unwillingness, rather than inability, to pay) in recent history.
The second lesson, and the one most pertinent to Europe now, concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario.
Indeed, almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount.
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “credit event” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices.
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (that is, that private bondholders take a real hit) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005.
In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50%.
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out.
Only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring.
In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to default.
Can Greece, with the EFSF’s help, obtain debt relief while avoiding default?
Small purchases at current panic prices, vulture-fund style, are always possible, but they do not promise substantial debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market, defeating the point of the whole operation.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced.
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way, say, by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market?
Naturally, the spread would automatically converge to the threshold, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders?
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount, the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal.
After all, by capping spreads, the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason, perhaps, to make the facility a temporary offer.
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders.
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to succeed in inducing a haircut, it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate.
Without Ecuador’s gimmicks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece’s debt overhang.
Atlanta &#45;&#45; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air, or land. An entire population is being brutally punished.
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006.
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.
Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza.  Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Regardless of one’s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water, food, electricity, and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza, about one million of whom are refugees.
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children.
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age.
On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants.
Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria.
I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused.
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community.
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “security.”
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people.
This holds promise of progress, but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, a retrogression has occurred in the process.
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened.
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly.
It is time for strong voices in Europe, the US, Israel, and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people. 
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests.
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch.  It will also revise the supplementary budget as well.
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister.
Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament).
Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.
And what of the LDP?
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.
Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role.
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time.
But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased.
Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey.
But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.
In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.
It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs.
It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel.
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes.
If this pledge is adopted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace.
In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?
We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.
Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided.
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.
But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation.
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations.
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul’s visit to Yerevan, real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries’ closed border – the last in Europe.
Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era.
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured.
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera’s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past.
Other examples come to mind: the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa, Romania’s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade’s fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged “Jewish monopoly of suffering” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag.
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.
A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, that Manichean mindset, with its oversimplifications and manipulations, was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power. 
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.
In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989, it had almost four million.
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu’s execution, most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel, both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society.
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura, untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements, must derive great pleasure from watching today’s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old Communist, reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend’s girlfriend.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera’s name was contained in the investigating officer’s report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”
Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.”
Butif it happened, the case calls for a deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950’s was the most brutal period of “proletarian dictatorship” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers, fierce opponents, and apathetic bystanders alike.
Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique.
In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS.
Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police.
Daily life under totalitarianism, be it communist or fascist, was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding.
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability. We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist’s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work. 
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses?
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police.
Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal.
In order to understand that epoch, we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances, never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals.
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.
In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson.
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality.
LONDON – Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has been calling for the creation of  a “League of Democracies.”
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a “new quadrilateral security partnership” in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US.
Neither Russia nor China, of course, would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, argues McCain, because in matters vital to the US, such as fighting Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and spreading liberty, democracy, and free markets,  the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations (i.e., from Russia and China).
In other words, the League’s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs.
The most damning criticism of McCain’s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but incoherent.
Russia and China do not “threaten” the “free world” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world’s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: it was France, after all, which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, on issues like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, the US needs  Russian and Chinese help.
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
(China must learn to behave “responsibly,” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension.)  In fact, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “war against terrorism.”
Finally, the idea is impracticable.
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain’s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible.
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition, to which Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, often gave eloquent expression: democracies don’t fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, wars would stop.
Presumably, McCain’s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant’s dream of perpetual peace  closer to realization by putting  pressure on non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary.
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The affirmative answer  seems to depend on two separate claims.
The first is that democracies have, as a matter of historical record, never fought each other.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
Moroever, they are “our kind” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems, not “Islamic democracies” like Iran.
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other.”
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm?       
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
Members accept the obligation not  to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council.
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN.
But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including by the US.
By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war.
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism.
It is called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules.
It is full of faults, which need to be corrected.
But we don’t need a League of Democracies to do this.
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to retard the growth of trade, and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up.
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy!
This is the thrust of McCain’s message.
As he put it, the US was built for a purpose – to serve “eternal and universal principles.”
Its God-given task is to build an “enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity, and hope.”
Noble rhetoric!
But if that is the League’s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace.
This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image.
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more warlike.
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective, and one to which all the world’s major powers can sign up.
REYKJAVIK – If African countries were to adopt only one policy to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability, they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation across the continent as quickly as possible.
Doing so would most likely encourage trade, as happened in Europe with the arrival of the euro, and could help contain inflation – which is always good for growth – by imposing international discipline on monetary policy.
The African Union is now aiming at pooling all the continent’s currencies into a single currency by 2028.
In the meantime, several regional monetary unions are on the drawing board, in addition to the two monetary unions that already exist, onede jure and the otherde facto.
The premier and oldest of these unions is composed of the fourteen countries that belong to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which both use the CFA franc.
The second of these unions is composed of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African rand.
Disregarding Zimbabwe, a recent and incomplete convert, the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have, as intended, benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa.
To see why, consider Nigeria.
Before independence, Nigeria’s legal tender was the British pound.
With the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959, the Nigerian pound was introduced.
Back then, one Nigerian pound was equivalent to one British pound.
This arrangement remained intact until 1973, when Nigeria adopted a new currency, the naira.
The exchange rate remained unchanged: one naira was equivalent to one British pound.
The naira was intended to bolster the country‘s independence by making it possible for the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy.
It was also a matter of national pride.
The thinking behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation‘s interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the naira to the pound.
But the naira’s introduction quickly put an end to parity with the British pound.
Government expenditure exceeded federal revenue, despite rapidly rising foreign-exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970.
The federal government’s budget deficits were financed through foreign and domestic borrowing, and by printing money, which led to inflation and depreciation of the new currency.
Today, it costs 220 naira to buy one British pound, which implies 15% annual average depreciation since 1973.
This depreciation would perhaps be justifiable had Nigeria managed to use easy money to narrow the gap between ordinary Nigerians’ standard of living and that of people living in Britain.
But that did not happen.
The purchasing power of national income per person in Nigeria is now 50% lower relative to Britain than in 1980.
In view of this experience, Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other West African countries (The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and perhaps Liberia).
But that planned monetary union, until recently envisaged to be launched in 2009, has now been put on ice.
Why?
The smallest countries show no signs of fear of being swamped by Nigeria, by far the most populous country in the group (accounting for 155 million of the six countries’ 200 million people), especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be located in Accra, the capital of Ghana (24 million).
Others, though, may fear the dilution of their sovereignty when the new Central Bank of theWest African Monetary Zonetakes over some of the policymaking responsibilities of national central banks.
But that, of course, is the chief purpose of a monetary union.
When the West African Monetary Zone finally is established, the number of currencies in Africa will equal about half the number of countries.
And when the East African Community with its five members (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) re-emerges as scheduled, the number of currencies will be reduced by another four.
The belief that sovereign national currencies, by enabling independent and flexible monetary policies, are the best way to foster economic and social development – the vision of Nigeria’s post-colonial leaders – is gradually falling by the wayside.
Efficiency dictates the use of fewer and larger currencies (and foreign investors, understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies, demand it).
Indeed, the success of the European Union and of the euro since its launch in 1999 has made a strong impression in Africa.Currencies, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, are like democracies: the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them.
NEW YORK – The countries known collectively as the PIIGS – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain – are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt.   Several of the worst-hit – Portugal, Ireland, and Greece – have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package, totaling 10% of GDP, its public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal – where growth has been stagnant for a decade – is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency.
In Ireland and Spain, transferring the banking system’s huge losses to the government’s balance sheet – on top of already-escalating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency.
The official approach, Plan A, has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch, not a solvency problem, and that the provision of bailout loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This “extend and pretend” or “lend and pray” approach is bound to fail, because, unfortunately, most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible.
For example, the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The only institution that can crank up the printing press – the European Central Bank – will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits.
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries.
The PIIGS’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible.
Moreover, whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain.
To restore growth, these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency, thus turning trade deficits into surpluses.
But a rising euro – pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB – implies more real appreciation, further undermining competitiveness.
The German solution to this conundrum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity, thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results.
If the PIIGS started that process today, the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last option – deflation of wages and prices – to reduce costs, achieve a real depreciation, and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher, making them even more unsustainable.
Lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings, and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts, aren’t options, either.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes’ paradox of thrift: declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP.
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes, cutting subsidies, and reducing government spending – even inefficient spending – would stifle growth in the short term, exacerbating the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS can’t inflate, grow, devalue, or save their way out of their problems, Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail.
The only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B – an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries’ governments, households, and banks.
This can happen in a number of ways.
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed.
This means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth.
In effect, these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country’s economy, entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring salvation.
No one will descend from the heavens, deus ex machina, to bail out the IMF or the EU.
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden, for the sake of the PIIGS, the EU, and their own bottom lines.
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly, right back to the days of opiates and cocaine, up through bromides, barbiturates, and tranquilizers: all proved to be highly addictive drugs, but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so.
Now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem.
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions.
In England, prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979.
It is now clear that today's anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being.
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects: substantial weight gain, loss of libido, and mood changes, to name just the most common complaints.
Suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years, but searching scientific investigations have only just begun.
An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom's drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug's use.
This may help, it but won't address the real issue: how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience, and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters, the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11, where thalidomide rates a 10.
Time will tell, but the key point is this: the thalidomide disaster of the 1950's and 1960's happened because there was no independent control of drug safety, whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate, expensive, and global regulatory system.
The nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm, but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain.
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated, it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms, as expose questions about what medicine is and should be.
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come.
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering, presenting, and communicating evidence.
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants, giving patients a collective voice, as never before.
Previously, drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients' reaction to medicines.
But this crisis revealed these reports' fundamental inadequacies, such that users' experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels' warnings.
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound: in 2003, one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2% to 25% (even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is "not habit forming" at all).
The anti-depressant crisis provides, for the first time, dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
To be sure, user reports are not "scientific" and most, individually, might seem naïve, confused, exaggerated, mistaken, and/or just plain self-absorbed.
Yet in this case they provided, collectively, more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials.
So, now the question is not so much the value of patients' reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science. "Just how tainted has clinical medicine become," asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002; the answer was "heavily and damagingly so."
The duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become.
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health.
But one feature above all others captures the underlying problem: the yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers, experts, and authorities who mince words.
The 1990's saw "depression" formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view, but deeply simplistic.
The term "drug dependence" was also redefined, to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting.
The ubiquitous term "discontinuation symptoms"--Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence.
On the contrary, wishful thinking led experts to adduce "discontinuation symptoms" as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies.
Later, suicides became routinely described as "non-accidental overdoses," and the broad-spectrum term "emotional lability" came into vogue, despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears.
By contrast, user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality, rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved.
In the long run, the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise, but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve.
WASHINGTON, DC ­– America’s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength, that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table.
If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators.
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: arguments that persuade, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex, effectively at the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York’s state attorney general – into the US financial sector’s residential lending and related securities practices.
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud.
More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony, evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman, was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual, Goldman, and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies.
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is little understood by America’s main financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and poses systemic market risk.
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function: price discovery between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe.
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “financial innovation.”
Kaufman’s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago.
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, “The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all... I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders.
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster; to be sure, they and many others are now listening.
On a third issue, the results so far are mixed.
Kaufman championed the case for making America’s biggest banks smaller, as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts.
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment, co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown, that would have imposed a hard cap on banks’ size and leverage (debt relative to assets).
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6.
It might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks.
Still, it has strengthened backing for another amendment, sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “dark” part of high-speed trading.
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque, and when powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden’s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election.
When he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let’s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector.
Kaufman’s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today’s complex, opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth.
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
ROME – US President Barack Obama’s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe’s division, can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings.
The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world.
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe’s peace, stability, and economic growth.
The continent’s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner.
And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States.
Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries.
They also spring from different factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation.
Europe’s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
Proposals for some sort of “partnership for transformation,” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, should bear in mind that the region’s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months.
No surprise, then, that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism, and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated.
Given this, the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region’s security.
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe’s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability, the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs.
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage.
The broad planks of a partnership are already there, so what is now needed is to enhance Europe’s integration with its southern neighbors.
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU “Plan for the Mediterranean” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources.
The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services.
Let us, together with the US, tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies.
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU’s internal market and participate in EU programs.
To achieve all of this, a clear set of principles is required.
We Europeans must favor stability, create a real spirit of co-ownership, and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period.
Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms.
Moreover, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task.
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank’s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa, with shares held by the region’s governments (or other institutions) and other willing parties.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises.
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe; there’s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a “dialogue among equals” on political and security matters, aimed at confidence-building across the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “mare nostrum.”
They are part of our collective history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build.
TOLEDO, SPAIN – This autumn, the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With this idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, a former Jordanian minister of water resources, proposed for the Middle East a “Water and Energy Union,” a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region.
The idea is compelling.
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that, over the past month, Joschka Fischer, Germany’s former foreign minister, has called for such a union.
So, too, have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal.
But the European “coal and steel union” became possible only after Europe’s major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end.
And past injustices will need to be put aside, so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging.
During the 1990’s, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed, because when the bilateral talks collapsed, readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
The necessary political framework also needs to be regional and, fortunately, it exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007, provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences, as well as a political basis for moving forward.
Adopting it is essential to moving forward, especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included.
Despite today’s chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change mindsets.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region’s water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable.
Coincidentally, over the past month, there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region, accompanied by an economic package, since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex, and the dangers of radicalism too advanced, to permit success through haphazard means.
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region’s peoples and mitigate future conflict.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern – water, energy, and politics.
WARSAW – The eurozone is often considered an experiment – a monetary union without political unification.
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state, which possesses two relevant features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who claim that “political union” is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature, despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states.
In this sense, they ignore the fact that the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union, not its substitute.
Indeed, the eurozone’s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
More fundamentally, monetary unions – in a broader sense – have existed not only within single states, but also in groups of sovereign states, the gold standard being the most notable example in history.
The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons.
First, they required fiscal discipline in the member states, which was true under the gold standard, with its informal norm of balanced budgets.
Second, they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center, because such a center did not exist.
Instead, a great deal of flexibility, including within their labor markets, facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption.
This would require an enhanced level of European identity, something which the Union’s political elites cannot generate artificially. &#160;But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve, but rather that it would not address the main problem: the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states.
Instead of looking at the wrong model – that of a single state – the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks.
First, utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt, with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles, which cause deep recessions – and thus sharp increases in budget deficits – when they burst.
Likewise, the European Central Bank’s monetary policy should “lean against the wind” by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles.
As the ECB’s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries, the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth.
Meanwhile, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions.
To be sure, initiatives at the EU and/or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics.
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states, and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries, which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone – and within the EU.
Second, beyond strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt, while the latter would help them to address unemployment.
Of the many necessary measures in this area, the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market, coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs.
Moreover, the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures – particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy – that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and/or hamper the flexibility of markets.
In this respect, the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important.
As EU members already have large tax burdens, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Thus, fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments, which –given the aging of EU societies – must include raising the retirement age.
Finally, rigid labor markets and, more generally, regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy, deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks, and contribute to the growth of unemployment.
Therefore, labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda.
European elites are fond of exclamations about “European solidarity,” “social cohesion,” and the “European social model.”
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here – or obviate the need for them.
LONDON – There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers.
Now they are a global obsession.
There are school and university league tables, rankings of companies on profitability or corporate social responsibility, tables of happiness indicators by country, and tables that attempt to rank consumer brands by value.
There is even a league table of the world’s funniest jokes (I did not laugh much).
The financial world is also full of such rankings.
Investment bankers wait with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables, even though the link between a high ranking and profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent.
Bank league tables have been with us for a while, and now tend to be based on capital strength, rather than asset volume, which is an improvement of sorts, but still not very meaningful.
There are also now several different league tables – which are generating considerable angst – that rank financial centers based largely on surveys of firms.
How badly the financial crisis damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question increasingly asked in London, and to a lesser extent in New York.
(Some Americans tend to think that the world will beat a path to their door, no matter how badly they are received when they arrive!)
So far, the message from the most recent tables is not too alarming for the incumbents.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league.
The Banker magazine produces another, with New York on top and London a close second – though the distance between them and their pursuers is narrowing.
The scores in both London and New York for the quality and intensity of regulation, and the tax burden, have dropped.
Firms seem nervous about the future in both areas. 
The most striking change in the rankings is the rise of major Asian financial centers – and not just Hong Kong and Singapore, but also Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen.
The Chinese have been explicitly promoting their financial centers, and the impact is beginning to be seen.
The World Economic Forum’s Financial Development Index – yet another league table to consider – shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close indeed to London, with China now ahead of Italy on the overall measure of financial sophistication.
Noodles are beating spaghetti.
Some of this is unsurprising.
As the world’s center of economic gravity shifts east, the balance of financial activity is bound to move with it.
On the principle that if something is inevitable, it is wise to welcome it, the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of collaborating with these new centers.
But the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving.
That is far harder to judge.
There are anecdotes about individual hedge-fund managers moving to Geneva.
Every time a government, or a regulator, announces some new control, or a tightening of existing controls, there are threats from bankers that they will pack up and leave town, taking their Porsches and mistresses with them. 
These threats, which used to have a lot of political impact, are now much less effective.
Some politicians and commentators quickly say, “Good riddance.” Even the Bank of England has asked whether, given the cost of mopping up the mess caused by the latest crisis, it is worth playing host to a global financial market.
This is risky speculation.
However badly bankers have behaved – and some clearly deserve a decade or more in the sin bin – financial services are a crucial element of London’s economy.
If the financial sector declines, what will replace it in employment terms?
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession (a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just that – empty words.
There are few, if any, examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale once it has declined.
London, in particular, has no inalienable right to be a global financial center.
The United Kingdom’s domestic market is, after all, much smaller than that of the United States.
Indeed, the location of financial activity has changed through the centuries.
If incumbency were a permanent advantage, Goldman Sachs’ global headquarters would be in Babylon.
There must be a tipping point at which some combination of higher taxation, more burdensome regulation, and a hostile political climate causes financial firms to relocate. 
There is a risk that Britain may now be approaching that point.
That is why the UK’s Financial Services Authority, and even the Confederation of British Industry, which speaks largely for non-financial firms concerned about access to credit, has begun to call for a truce between the authorities and financial markets.
The next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out, and, if it does, whether it will endure.
As is always the case in peace negotiations, both sides must be willing to compromise.
Firms will need to show visible restraint when it comes to this year’s bonus round.
The British government will not tolerate another jamboree.
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will need to decide just how far they want to go in punishing banks.
Continued threats of ever-higher tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive.
If we fail to settle on a new social contract between the state and the markets soon, those markets may indeed move elsewhere.
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia’s bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe. Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu: just as in the KGB’s heyday, people simply disappear in Putin’s Russia.
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia’s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya’s killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn’t inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia’s President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow,Novaya Gazeta, and in her books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin’s presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin’s enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin’s Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set: DVDs, computers, game boxes, smart phones, and more.
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects.
The United States led the world into the television age, and the implications can be seen most directly in America’s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called “the glass teat.”
In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere, and the poorest countries are still not there.
True to form, Americans became the greatest TV watchers, which is probably still true today, even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete.
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours.
In Scandinavia, for example, time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average.
The consequences for American society are profound, troubling, and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure.
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse.
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do.
Moreover, heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.
Robert Putnam, the leading scholar of America’s declining sense of community, has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “social capital,” the trust that binds communities together.
Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, many other factors are at work, but television-driven social atomization should not be understated.
Certainly, heavy TV viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health.
Americans lead the world in obesity, with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Again, many factors underlie this, including a diet of cheap, unhealthy fried foods, but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well.
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically.
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns, appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food, sex, and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same, of course, has happened to politics.
American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal.
Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle.
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war – Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction –in the familiar colorful, fast-paced, and graphics-heavy style of television advertising.
Then the war itself began with the so-called “shock and awe” bombing of Baghdad – a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development, and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media.
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households, but are also more likely to have a television in their room.
When a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises, economists call it an “inferior” good.
To be sure, the mass media can be useful as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid.
At the very least, we can minimize those dangers.
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising, especially to young children; non-commercial, publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC; and free (but limited) TV time for political campaigns.
Of course, the best defense is our own self-control.
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.
These are violent times.
Some believe that we are experiencing a new kind of conflict: “culture wars,” such as those between Sunni and Shiite Muslims or tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or indeed Islamists and Westerners.
However, the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be more traditional.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
Ruthless leaders mobilize disoriented followers.
Particularly the losers, often represented by young men with no future to look forward to, can be induced to take even suicidal action against the alleged enemy.
Perhaps one should not be surprised that at such a time, the oldest of our ugly ­– indeed, deadly – resentments, anti-Semitism, is re-emerging from the shadows.
Its comeback takes the classical form of attacks on individuals, like the recent killing of a young Jew in France, or of disfiguring symbolic places, like cemeteries and synagogues.
But there is also a more general sense of hostility to all things Jewish.
One would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust; but it did not.
There are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place, or that it did in its all-too-well-documented manner.
The deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran’s recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The evidence of what Nazi Germany did is so powerful that those who deny it can probably be dealt with even without putting them in prison and thereby drawing more attention to them than they deserve.
The more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism.
It has to do with Israel.
To be sure, America is the first name in anti-Western resentment.
But its second name is Israel, the only successful modern country in the Middle East, which is also highly militarized, an occupying power, and ruthless in defense of its interests.
It is difficult to exaggerate the strange sentiment in the West which one might call Palestine romanticism.
Intellectuals like the late Edward Said gave voice to it, but it has many followers in the United States and Europe.
Palestine romanticism glorifies the Palestinians as the victims of Israel’s rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as at best second-class citizens, and cites the many incidents of oppression in the occupied territories, including the effects of Israel’s “security fence.”
Implicitly or explicitly, people take the side of the victims, contribute by sending money to them, declare even suicide bombers legitimate, and move ever further away from support for and defense of Israel.
Of course, it is true that in theory one can oppose Israel’s policies without being anti-Semitic.
After all, there are enough critics of Israel’s policies among Israelis.
Yet the distinction has become more and more difficult to maintain.
Jews outside Israel feel that they have to defend – right or wrong – the country that, after all, is their ultimate hope of security.
This makes their friends hesitate to speak up for fear of being painted into not just an anti-Israel, but also an anti-Semitic corner.
The defensiveness of Jews and the uneasy silence of their friends mean that the stage of public debate is open for those who actually are anti-Semitic, though they confine themselves to anti-Israel language.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises.
This is true also for other kinds of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique, because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people.
The new anti-Semitism, however, cannot be fought successfully by education and argument in the rest of the world alone.
It is linked to Israel.
If one belongs to a generation that regarded Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, and admired the way in which the country provided a proud home for the persecuted and downtrodden, one is particularly concerned that it may now be at risk.
SEOUL – The long-delayed meeting of North Korea’s ruling Worker’s Party is now underway, and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community.
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il’s third son, Kim Jong-eun, will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father’s successor.
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place, allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base.
Whatever happens, and whoever turns out to be the new leader, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system’s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges.
Moreover, responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang.
North Korea’s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker’s Party conference, held for the first time in three decades, was abruptly postponed earlier in September.
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite, a group that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before.
Moreover, Kim’s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess, further complicating matters.
“Enough is enough,” a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun’s likely succession.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il’s inheritance of power from his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control, given the economy’s utter state of decay, as last year’s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated.
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society, and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation.
For example, for the first time, North Korea’s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination.
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea’s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally.
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance.
And, at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation, North Korea’s leaders, their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons, might try to distract their public through audacious, and possibly destructive, acts abroad.
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come.
Indeed, the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime’s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture – the latter being the authorities’ fearful response to the former.
Unfortunately, however, most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
Of course, in order to pressure North Korea’s government to give up its nuclear option, the current international economic sanctions, which target WMD-related products and luxury goods, probably should continue.
But, at the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform.
At a time of increased tension between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
If, say, North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime’s will to reform.
In fact, following the recent currency fiasco, North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy, which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.
To be sure, North Korea’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered.
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform.
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, it may be impossible to win North Korea’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change.  
The past two decades have shown that “politically correct” decisions do not produce the “right” results, even in the long run.
As North Korea grooms a new leader, the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea.
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner was the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has erupted.
The United States is pressing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms are not forthcoming.
The Secretary General has submitted a reasonable reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting together as the so-called G-77, are balking, because they regard it as another step in reducing the authority of the General Assembly relative to the Security Council.
In particular, they object to the plan’s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General, whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council’s five permanent members, which wield veto power.
Many UN members, believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly, resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the Assembly’s Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management over personnel and expenditure that ought to be exercised by the Secretary General if the UN is to operate effectively and to have a staff which is up to the challenges facing the organization.
This is the basis of America’s insistence on administrative reforms.
There is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would mean an effective end to all efforts to reform the UN, with disastrous consequences for people across the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Program, the security provided by the UN’s numerous peacekeeping operations, or the myriad other services rendered by UN agencies.
For example, failure of management reform would fuel demands by the US Congress to withhold America’s contributions to the UN budget – a policy that would greatly undermine America’s own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to stop genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution is clear: give the General Assembly a greater role in the selection of the Secretary General so that members would be delegating powers to an authority of their own choosing.
This solution would not only permit the much-needed administrative reforms to be implemented; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in great need of improvement.
After all, the UN Charter provides that “the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.”
The original concept was that the two bodies would reach a consensus on a candidate.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Real discussions about a new Secretary General are currently being conducted in secrecy among the permanent five, adding to the frustration of other UN members, including large powers that have been seeking without success to enlarge the Security Council.
To achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants, the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process.
This might be done in several ways.
The Security Council might agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly might propose several candidates to the Security Council, from which the Council would choose one to refer back to the Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
For example, the General Assembly should hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed, thereby greatly enhancing the stature of the candidate who is eventually selected.
Such proposals, if accepted, would help resolve the current dispute to everyone’s satisfaction.
Indeed, they could make the UN stronger than it has ever been.
A remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
Earlier this year, the government suspended publication of the newspaperBing Dian Weekly, provoking unprecedented open protest, which received extensive media coverage worldwide.
Even more surprisingly, the government, under the pressure of public opinion, has allowedBing Dianto resume publication.
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked, but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government’s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact.
Foreign observers are prone to associate theBing Dianincident with other recent crackdowns on China’s mass media, and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation.
Undeniably, there has been no significant change in the government’s system of journalism’s regulation since China adopted its “open door” policy almost 30 years ago.
On the contrary, it has become more rigorous and covert.
But I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring.
A prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller’s ideology.
After 1949, the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “theoretical experts” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.”
But nowadays, such writers are hard to find, and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm.
In fact, the Central Propaganda Department’s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls, which are widely scorned.
More importantly, even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines.
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of Propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs.
In private conversation, one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity.
For their part, producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda.
I started my career with China Youth Dailyin 1979 and have experienced the whole process of China’s opening up and reformation.
Our generation of Chinese journalists broke from traditional Communist ideas about journalism by the mid-1980’s through extensive reading of Western journalism.
Younger journalists have thus been exposed to Western journalistic ideas from the very beginning.
Indeed, Western works are taught as “models for writing” to journalism students in China’s universities.
This is a crucial change, and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China’s media today.
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change.
Contrary to foreign perceptions, only a handful of Chinese media – for example,People’s Daily, Guang Ming Daily, and theEconomic Daily – still live on government funds.China Central Television relies mainly on its advertising income, with only a symbolic fraction of its massive budget covered by the government.
Whether most media outlet can survive is thus solely dependent on their market success.
To be sure, political information remains rigorously controlled, which puts a premium on “harmless” recreational, entertainment, and sports information – the reporting of which is basically free.
This has resulted, in the short run, in an embrace of low journalistic standards.
But many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years.
Sooner or later, readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions.
In fact, it is these tabloids, responding to market pressure, that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs.
On many occasions in recent years, they have been the first to break sensitive news.
As a result, mainstream media are being marginalized, and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream.
Thus, even without any change in the current system of regulation, extensive coverage of disasters, judicial abuses, and citizens’ pursuit of their statutory rights, along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives, is now common.
For example, reporting by theSouth Metropolitan Daily led to the abolition of an outdated housing ordinance issued by the State Council.Cai Jing magazine’s continuous reporting on SARS enabled the Chinese public to learn the truth about this epidemic.
TheBing DianWeekly ofChina Youth Dailypublished an article by Taiwanese writer Long Yingtai on Taiwan’s democratic development.
Such progress is slow and full of frustrations, for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system.
But it is nonetheless real progress, indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China’s becoming a country of “free expression”.
According to an old Chinese saying, “a just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds scant support.” A “just cause” resides in people’s hearts.
Without the hearts of news producers – or, increasingly, of censors – the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will, sooner or later, collapse like the Berlin Wall.
NEW YORK – Many poor, food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months, as global prices of rice, wheat, and maize have doubled.
Hundreds of millions of poor people, who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food, are being pushed to the edge.
Food riots are mounting. 
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves, because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible.
In some cases, with appropriate government action, they could double or even triple food production in just a few years. 
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season, lack fertilizer, depend on rain rather than irrigation, and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe.
Their farms are small, perhaps one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
Under traditional agricultural conditions, the yields of grain – rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare, for one planting season per year.
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare, this means extreme poverty, and for their country, it means reliance on expensive food imports, including food aid. 
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare.
If water can be managed through irrigation, this could be combined with multi-cropping (multiple harvests per year) to produce a crop during the dry season.
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families, and lower food prices for cities.
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties (usually “hybrid” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties), chemical fertilizers, organic matter to replenish soil nutrients, and, where possible, small-scale irrigation methods, such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well.
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries.
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral, they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation.
As a result, they grow food the traditional way, often earning little or nothing from their harvest, because it’s not even enough to keep their families alive.
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
With a bit of temporary help, perhaps lasting around five years, farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis, either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans.
Around the world, government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs, but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies.
Of course, there were abuses, such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones, or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy.
And in many cases, government agricultural banks went bankrupt.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
During the debt crisis of the 1980’s and 1990’s, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems.
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves, to let “market forces” provide for inputs.
This was a profound mistake: there were no such market forces. 
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties.
They could not obtain bank financing.
To its credit, the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year.
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries, notably those farming on two hectares or less, to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons, and has doubled its food production as a result.
Other low-income countries should follow suit.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs, then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time.
Donor governments, including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, should help finance the World Bank’s new efforts.
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions (such as Haiti) during the next five years.
That’s achievable if the World Bank, donor governments, and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world’s poorest farmers.
Whatever happened to the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy?
Not only is the public almost entirely ignorant of the EU’s policy agenda for boosting competitiveness, economic growth, and employment, but this ignorance extends to many intellectuals, academics, CEO’s, and even some MP’s.
For example, in all of the debates on the EU’s constitutional treaty, neither its supporters nor its opponents have so much as mentioned the Lisbon Strategy.
It is little wonder, then, that Euroskepticism – in France, the Netherlands, and elsewhere – is on the rise.
Despite the success and popularity of programs like ERASMUS, citizens don’t perceive the EU’s contribution to superior education or training.
Indeed, the last Eurobarometer survey on the Lisbon Strategy found that the European public sees little relation between EU policies and economic competitiveness.
Of course, some laboratories receive EU grants, but without recognizing a specific European mission in research policies.
Europe is generally considered more a constraint than as a plan, more as an instrument than a vision nourished by a clear and credible idea.
The essential responsibility for this state of affairs lies with Europe’s ruling class and policymakers.
As a recent assessment by former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok pointed out, the EU’s member states generally have not made the Lisbon Strategy a high priority, and they balk at giving the EU the means to pursue more ambitious policies to offset this neglect.
It is difficult to ask citizens to be enthusiastic about aims that their leaders ignore.
At bottom, the problem is one of legitimacy.
The main targets – jobs, growth, and research – are considered legitimate from the standpoint of fairness when described in general terms.
But the concrete policies needed to realize this aim are not, since reforming the welfare state and labor markets means more competition, which scares many citizens.
Legitimacy is even more problematic regarding recognition, which implies a feeling of community and attachment.
When we are faced with conflicting choices – burden-sharing through taxation, the organization of the public sector, the status of public employees, etc. – the member states are considered to be the only bodies entitled to decide.
In short, when the EU brings subsidies, it receives congratulations; but when it pushes for unpopular reforms, it becomes the scapegoat for political, social, and economic failures.
From an economic point of view, the Lisbon Strategy’s aim is to transform Europe into a power able to compete on equal terms with the US today and the great Asian countries.
But this aim does not appear to be creating a European identity, as the euro has.
Within many states, “power” isn’t politically correct.
Above all, there is no linkage between national power and European power.
If we want Europe to be more legitimate, we must explain how to tie these two dimensions of power.
Aside from ignorance of the Lisbon Strategy among the public and inaction on long-term reforms among the member states, a second problem concerns the lack of acceptance of the virtues of competition – the most effective way to ensure quality, innovation, and low prices for consumers.
Competition also puts an end to rent seeking and protection of traditional corporate advantages.
Of course, we must limit the scope of competition: there is no reason, for example, to extend it to taxation.
Similarly, while competition will improve the quality of research and education, this does not imply reduced public funding, a lower priority for basic research, or the elimination of scholarships.
Perhaps most importantly, competition is a powerful means to restore democracy and modernize political institutions by compelling policymakers to ensure transparency and accountability.
Elites must give up their privileges, and regulations on corporate governance must limit collusion between managers and civil servants or politicians.
We must explain to citizens Europe’s contribution to public ethics, and the democratic virtues of fair competition in economic, political, and social life.
Consider one of the main purposes of the Lisbon Strategy: the organization of research and higher education.
It is impossible to change radically the way scholars and research workers are appointed in most member states, and to revise completely the criteria for funding of faculties and laboratories.
But the EU can overcome national impediments by developing exemplary universities and research centers that would be properly European, serving as an incentive to quality and reform at the national level.
Emulation through excellence is the motor of competitiveness.
A good place to start is an idea supported by French Socialist leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has proposed that 0.25% of Europe’s GDP be dedicated to research and used to create a European Agency for Research.
Moreover, Europe must build up tools for strategic analysis, assessment, and forecasting to provoke and nourish public debate.
Such think tanks at the European level must remain free and independent, but leaders must learn to pay attention to and integrate their recommendations into the policy-making process.
In many matters pertaining to the Lisbon Strategy, the EU cannot avoid member states’ concerns.
But as the states won’t be able to do everything alone and won’t renounce maintaining political control, we must be able to link the Union’s policies and those of specific states.
Otherwise, the Lisbon Strategy could merely empower an inefficient bureaucracy, rather than boosting the EU’s democratic legitimacy.
In short, the Lisbon Strategy could lead Europe to become a real power in the coming decades, or it could fuel further growth of Euroskepticism.
As former members of our countries' congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American Parliamentary Union (NAPU) to address the growing number of big issues that North America's national governments have pushed to the sidelines.
Both past and present have been burdened by thead hoc nature of relations among the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
A fairer, more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward.
Despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's snide reference to ``Old Europe,'' North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament.
In the 1950's, most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream.
Today the EU elects its Parliament, shares a single currency, and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries.
Within the near future, the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong.
The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people.
Yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration, cross border security, labor rights, and environmental degradation; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia.
On the contrary, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, relations between the US and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are at their lowest level in years.
Clearly, efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle.
In the near future, the US government will be focused on homeland security, Iraq, the slumping domestic economy, and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.
Canada's government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context; furthermore, Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease, as well as anticipating a new government next year.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006.
But his vision of a North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and by his political rivals' recent successes at the polls.
Notwithstanding this, most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa, Washington, or Mexico City.
Not only are Canada and Mexico the US's first and second largest trading partners, but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business, tourism, and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments.
Good feelings abound.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
In proposing the creation of NAPU, we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies.
In just a single decade, the EU managed to bring poorer, peripheral member states--Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland--from 50% to 90% of the EU average in per capita income, creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries, and stemming migration from poorer southern economies.
The EU invested upwards of $35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration.
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common,'' preferring to focus on ``market.''
This blinded all three countries to the centrality of community.
We have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap.
A regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration.
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries.
Regretfully, this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
Immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence.
Demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border.
Without Mexican manpower, much of the work in the US simply would not get done.
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized.
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern.
Everywhere nowadays, key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites, often in non-transparent circumstances.
NAPU would allow for wider, more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries.
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.
Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United States has been the world’s undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This is one unclaimed opportunity.
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
The US has made profound missteps recently.
“Matters of faith” have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to “values.”
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980’s.
Japan’s chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book calledTheJapan that Can Say No.
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the “food chain” of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book’s title refers to Japan’s plan to “say no” to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
LONDON &#45;&#45; The recent meeting in the Vatican of the “Custodian of The Holy Places,” King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Pope Benedict XVI was a seminal event, particularly as it comes at a time when radical Muslims are decrying the role of “crusaders” in Middle East politics.
It was also the clearest sign yet of a rising “Holy Alliance” among the world’s conservative leaders.
For the key audience for this meeting of Muslim king and Roman Catholic Pontiff was not their followers, but another conservative leader, President George W. Bush.
The first “Holy Alliance” was a creation of Austria’s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars.
It was an attempt to preserve the peace (and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values.
Metternich’s “Holy Alliance” was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon’s defeat.
Behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance: the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations.
The vested interests that the Alliance members – Austria, Prussia, and Russia – had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that, in the past, they would have pursued as a matter of course.
Metternich’s system worked through much of the nineteenth century, because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values.
But what “common values” do King, Pope, and American President share?
That such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve.
Indeed, Abdullah, who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world, is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith.
The two men met, seemingly as equals, not to express the common values of conservatism, but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values.
Both agreed that reform must be slow, cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions, especially religion and the patriarchal family.
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives.
Until then, he and Bush shared a common worldview, emphasizing the importance of religion, the traditional family (as both countries understood it), social discipline, and the state’s role in supporting these institutions.
But Bush, following the terrorist attacks of 2001, turned his back on conservatism.  He sought to radically reinvent the Middle East, not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, but also through his strident calls for democratization.
American radicalism, however, resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East, and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony.
Since 2001, Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region, including even Lebanon’s Maronite Christian community.
And in Iraq, Sunni Muslims feel under siege from the country’s majority and now ruling Shia.
Here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in.
Abdullah, perhaps earlier than most others, understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all.
Moreover, Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built.
The King, like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers, understands de Tocqueville’s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform.
Having begun, ever so carefully, to politically open his country, the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage.
The problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs.
The Wahhabi religious establishment, the Saudi state’s hidden co-rulers, could very well obstruct Abdullah’s attempts at regional religious reconciliation.
Members of the religious police remain adamant that the country’s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior.
While the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money, the sect’s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading, stoning, or lashing in Riyadh’s public square.
Thus, uniting the forces of status quo conservatism, even if some of those conservatives are Christian, is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia.
For conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability, especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb.
After all, few political systems can defend against those, like Saudi Arabia’s Islamic radicals, who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers. 
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers (including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism), Abdullah believes, can restore some stability to the Middle East.
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is a cause for true celebration everywhere.
But celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency.
Yes, the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan's leadership.
But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains, in many parts of the world and for many of the world's most complex problems, more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality.
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest.
Beyond states, the world's many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence, but without formal rules to define their role in the international system.
Their real power, despite Secretary General Annan's efforts to create a dialogue with them, stands outside the UN framework.
Indeed, NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak.
To assist them in their tasks, and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide, the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO's are working so impressively.
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN's internal structure.
When the UN was founded in 1945, the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III.
So, at its foundation, only one powerful body was introduced, the Security Council on which the world's great military powers sat.
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power, and meeting crises, mostly with military means.
Today, however, the real threats to the majority of the world's population stems from dangers almost unknown back then: poverty, hunger, population growth, migration, the environment, and the like.
For the UN to meet these challenges, its very structure must change.
Two new councils, each with comparable power to the Security Council, are needed: a Social Council and an Economic Council.
The IMF, World Bank, and WTO should not only report to, but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure.
Why are these new bodies needed?
The world cannot do without rules; it cannot move forward against our age's most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law.
Because these institutions do not exist, the UN must now invent them.
Of course some rules, such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions, now exist within, say, the WTO.
These rules, however, are but steps in the right direction: steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism, especially that often practiced by rich countries.
Across the board, more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty, disease, and mass migration can be made consistent, predictable and most of all effective.
We have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN; and we now have a large coalition, far beyond NATO, combatting terrorism.
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was, if I am not mistaken, a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-à-vis the UN.
But it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change, namely, to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN, make more progress.
In dangerous times such as these, the world's peoples need to prove their solidarity.
The large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this.
But solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN.
The Secretary General convocation of a ``Dialogue of Civilizations'' is but a start here.
Far more needs to be done.
The institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction.
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council.
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate.
So far, none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful.
But just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable, the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals, but as the only means for the world's people, in solidarity, to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face.
NEW YORK – The solution to manmade climate change depends on the transition to electricity production that, unlike burning oil, natural gas, and coal, emits little or no carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
Low-carbon electricity can be produced by solar, nuclear, and wind energy, or by coal-burning power plants that capture and store their CO2 emissions.  
The policy problem is simple.
Coal is a cheaper and more easily used energy source than the alternatives.
It is cheap because it is plentiful.
It is easier to use than wind or solar power because it can produce electricity around the clock, without reliance on weather conditions. 
To save the planet, we need to induce power suppliers to adopt low-carbon energy sources despite coal’s lower price and greater ease of use.
The obvious way is to tax coal, or to require power plants to have permits to use coal, and to set the tax or permit price high enough to induce a shift towards the low-carbon alternatives.
Suppose coal produces electricity at a cost of $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, while solar power costs $0.16/kilowatt-hour.
The tax on coal-based electricity would have to be $0.10/kilowatt-hour.
In that case, consumers would pay $0.16/kilowatt-hour for either coal or solar.
The utilities would then shift to low-carbon solar power.
The switchover, however, would more than double the electricity bill in this example.    
Politicians are loath to impose such a tax, fearing a political backlash.
For years , this has stymied progress in the United States towards a low-carbon economy.
Yet several European countries have successfully introduced the idea of a “feed-in tariff,” which provides the core of a politically acceptable long-term solution.
A feed-in tariff subsidizes the low-carbon energy source rather than taxing the high-carbon energy source.
In our example, the government would pay a subsidy of $0.10/kilowatt-hour to the solar-power plant to make up the difference between the consumer price of $0.06 and the production cost of $0.16.
The consumer price remains unchanged, but the government must somehow pay for the subsidy.
Here is another way.
Suppose that we levy a small tax on existing coal power plants in order to pay for the solar subsidy, and then gradually raise consumers’ electricity bills as more and more solar plants are phased in.
The price charged to consumers would rise gradually from $0.06/kilowatt-hour to the full cost of $0.16/kilowatt-hour, but over a phase-in period of, say, 40 years (the lifespan of the newest of today’s coal plants).
Assume that as of 2010, the entire electricity system is coal-based, and that the electricity price paid by the consumers is $0.06/kilowatt-hour.
By 2014, suppose that 10% of the 40-year transition to solar power has been achieved.
The consumer price is raised 10% of the way from $0.06 to $0.16, thus reaching $0.07/kilowatt-hour. 
The coal tax for 2014 is then set at $0.01/kilowatt-hour, which is just enough to pay the needed solar subsidy of $0.09/kilowatt-hour.
Solar producers fully cover their costs of $0.16/kilowatt-hour, since they sell power to the consumers at $0.07/kilowatt-hour and receive a subsidy of $0.09/kilowatt-hour.
A small coal tax can support a large solar subsidy.
Suppose, further, that by 2030 the transition to a low-carbon economy is halfway completed.
The consumer price for electricity is now set at $0.11, exactly halfway between $0.06 and $0.16.
The coal tax is now raised to $0.05/kilowatt-hour, just enough to cover the solar subsidy of $0.05/kilowatt-hour.
Once again, the solar producers cover their costs exactly, since the subsidy of $0.05/kilowatt-hour closes the gap between the consumer price ($0.11/kilowatt-hour) and the producer cost ($0.16/kilowatt-hour).
Let us presume, finally, that by 2050, all electricity production has made the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
The consumer price finally reaches $0.16/kilowatt-hour, enough to cover the full cost of solar power without a further subsidy.
This approach allows higher consumer electricity prices to be phased in gradually, yet establishes strong, immediate incentives for adopting solar power.
Moreover, the government budget is balanced every year, since the coal tax pays for the solar subsidy.
The actual transformation in the coming years will have one major advantage compared to this illustration.
Today’s solar power plants might cost an extra $0.10/kilowatt-hour compared to coal, but such plants will be much less costly in the future because of improved technology.
Thus, the magnitude of subsidies needed in a decade or two will be lower than they are today.
Energy debates in the US, Australia, and other countries have centered so far on introducing a cumbersome cap-and-trade permit system.
Every major user of fossil fuel would need to buy permits to emit CO2, and those permits would trade in a special marketplace.
The market price of the permits would be equivalent to paying a tax on CO2 emissions. 
Unfortunately, cap-and-trade systems are difficult to manage and don’t give clear signals about the future price of permits.
Europe has adopted such a system, but other parts of the world have repeatedly rejected it.
In fact, Europe’s biggest successes in promoting low-carbon energy have come from its feed-in tariffs, and carbon taxes in some countries, rather than its cap-and-trade system.  
The time has come for the US, China, India, and other major economies to declare how they will foster their own transition to a low-carbon economy.
A small and gradually rising carbon tax that funds a feed-in tariff system could win political support in the US.
It could also help to foster consensus among the major coal-based economies, including China and India.  
There really are effective long-term solutions to manmade climate change that are politically acceptable and feasible to implement.
It is time to embrace them.
An unusual meeting of scientists took place in Paris this summer, when scientists gathered to brainstorm about the need for a new science, one that could be as revolutionary as Einstein’s insights were a century ago.
Most scientists assume that the basics of science are known.
In terms of big challenges, the conventional wisdom is that few things are left to discover.
The remaining options are said to fall into three groups: “grand scientific quandaries” (such as uniting gravity and electricity into one theory) which require a huge investment and first world infrastructure; “data collection,” which is the field work associated with archeological digs and biological/genetic surveys; and “science-informed problems,” such as combating AIDS or addressing global warming.
Beyond that, many believe the only hard work will be to use existing laws to benefit humankind in new technological ways.
Who can argue?
After all, today’s models work.
But an emerging group of scientists points to phenomena that current theories do not address well.
These problems are exceedingly common and artfully avoided because the science that would account for them just doesn’t exist.
This missing science would describe processes, and how entire systems evolve.
Individual scientific disciplines are understood fairly well.
Physics, at least the physics we encounter as ordinary humans, is well mapped.
Chemistry and biochemistry are similarly solid -- there are some things we don’t understand about the body, but it is believed that the basic machinery of how cells and molecules interact is known.
Slightly apart from these are the new social sciences, which deal with humans and societies.
In each of these areas -- physics, biochemistry and social science -- the theories are mature and largely uncontroversial.
Each discipline has its own language and its own separate machinery.
Rarely is a scientist an expert in more than one area, because the worlds and languages are so different.
This means that we can’t answer complex questions that depend on more than one field.
Consider the brain, for example.
This complex organ is composed of molecules that interact using the principles of physics.
That information moves according to the laws of electricity.
There is also a system of specialized cells, and these interact, exchanging chemicals that also convey information.
The interaction between two brains adds another level: here, information is exchanged by means of languages, signs and ideas.
Information is at work on each level and comfortable theories explain how the separate ones operate.
But information is being exchanged between the levels as well. There is no science that explains this, even at the most rudimentary level.
To cope with this deficiency, some scientists have tried to reinvent the tools of one level in order to apply them to another.
This leads to such things as a “language” at the level of cells and “energy” behind organized societies.
Sometimes the transplant works well enough, but it does not address the central problem: What is the nature of the information conveyed between each level, and how is it conveyed?
As it happens, nearly every system in the world is composed of such layers.
A similarly embarrassing lack of understanding about how the whole system works exists in every case.
The group of interdisciplinary scientists that met in Paris is loosely affiliated under the banner “Foundations of Information Science.”
They have been working in a distributed collaboration for eight years and come from a range of countries and specialties.
As well as scientists from the relevant disciplines, art theorists, psychiatrists, language experts and philosophers are beginning to participate in the discussion.
Most of the group is banking on the “transplant” strategy, in which the basic science of one layer is placed in another, tweaked and supplemented in order to be functional.
Others think that a whole new approach is required.
They assume that many scientific conventions are accidents of history and new abstractions can be devised.
If the FIS group is lucky, there will also be some radical input from thinkers that do not presently have access to first world infrastructure.
Independent thinking is an underestimated factor.
Nearly all the activities collected under the banner of “science” have developed institutional tendencies that are similar to their economic counterparts.
It is usually assumed that developing economies need to build resources that emulate those in the developed world, but this could actually stifle the most creative thinking.
Many scientific disciples are going through a revolution, and a lot of those ideas -- sometimes revolutionary ideas -- are bubbling up from labs and research centers that are unaffiliated with large institutions.
Twenty years of the most advanced thinking for mathematical algorithms came from a Soviet empire starved of computing power.
The cleverest, most literally earth-shattering notions of physics for two generations came not from the expected powerhouses of the day, but from Budapest.
Iran has a tradition of architectural design that has revealed key insights to cognitive scientists.
Today, some of the most radical new ideas in second generation artificial intelligence (so-called “autonomous agents”) are incubating in Prague.
The most creative breakthroughs became famous events.
When Einstein added new abstractions to the language of physics, the identity of space and time changed.
The FIS meeting in July was the unheralded beginning of an attempt to remodel the universe in such a way.
The group identified the gaps that need explanation.
They will expand their pool of thinkers to include scientists from necessarily innovative regions.
Following this, they will identify which problems might be solved if this new science is developed.
Or if you wish, discovered.
VIENNA – US President Barack Obama has injected fresh momentum into efforts – stalled for a decade – to bring about nuclear disarmament.
He has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states.
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The non-proliferation regime, of which the NPT is the cornerstone, is in disarray.
The main problems are easily identified.
First, the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament.
Instead, they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals.
This naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons, which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence, and an insurance policy against attack.
Second, as we have seen in the case of North Korea, there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that “extraordinary events” have jeopardized their supreme interests.
Third, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system, is shamefully underfunded.
When it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program, IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied, either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary, or because the IAEA’s analytical laboratories are outdated, or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery.
Fourth, export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.
Nine countries already have nuclear weapons, and it would be naive to presume that others, particularly in regions of conflict, will not try to get hold of them.
In addition, a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability, if they choose, to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change, because they have mastered the critical technology – uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.
If more countries take this path, it could prove to be the Achilles’ heel of non-proliferation.
Fifth, the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council, has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation.
These issues will not be resolved overnight.
But there is much that can be done relatively quickly.
The United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, which together account for 95% of the world’s 27,000 warheads.
Other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials, which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists; and strengthening the IAEA.
Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA’s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
LEU cannot be used to make weapons.
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy.
My proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons.
This would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants, and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability.
This could help to avoid a repeat of Iran’s experiences after its 1979 revolution, when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored.
Thirty years later, some of the consequences are still being felt.
The LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria.
It would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations.
No state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle.
The money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place, thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization – the Nuclear Threat Initiative – and initial funding from Warren Buffett.
But this can only be a first step.
It should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control, and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control.
This is a bold idea, but bold ideas are needed now more than ever.
The opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War.
The spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time.
On August 8, 2008, the world watched with awe the amazing spectacle of the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing.
We saw the electronic unrolling of Chinese scrolls replete with great historic symbols and were mesmerized by dancers creating “harmony,” using their bodies as ink brushes.
2008 martial arts students performed millennia-old moves with mechanical precision, while the flying celestials and the galloping torchbearer created a sense of heavenly abode on earth.
There was another time when China dazzled the world at its doorstep: the Tang dynasty (618-907), often thought of as China’s golden age, when it was truly the “middle kingdom” at the center of the universe.
Its capital, Chang Àn (modern day Xìan) was a world-class city; visitors came from all over the world and were dazzled by its wealth, beauty, and power.
Its emperors used silver from Persia, glass from Europe, precious stones from Central Asia, and gold implements from India.
Open, confident, and cosmopolitan, China connected with the world with ease, adopting new ideas, and projecting its own indigenous creations.
It’s no wonder that Chinese scholars sometimes refer to today’s China era as the new Tang Dynasty.
Indeed, when China was awarded the Olympic Games in 2001, the country’s official news agency, Xinhua called it a “milestone in China’s rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the Chinese nation.”
For seven years, Chinese officials and artists worked tirelessly to make this dream of a “renaissance” a glittering reality, and they exceeded all expectations.
But how should we understand the broader implications of the opening ceremony, both for China and the outside world?
First, the good news.
In keeping with China’s recent efforts to project its “soft” side, the opening ceremony produced the idea of a historic, but dynamic culture at its best. Other than the presence of a few People’s Liberation Army soldiers, you would have been hard pressed to find any visible evidence of the reigning communist regime or its founder, Mao Zedong.
Equally significant was the projection of China as a nascent leader of the new international cultural order.
The “Bird’s Nest” stadium was the creation of the multinational design team of Herzog &amp; de Meuron, with suggestions from the visual artist Ai Weiwei.
Many artists involved in the creation of the spectacle, including the fireworks specialist Cai Guo Qiang, the dance star Shen Wei, and the composer Tan Dun, earned their fame primarily in the West.
Even Zhang Yimou, the lead impresario for the event, gained fame in the West through his early films chronicling the hard life of a young modern China.
Chinese officials had clearly decided that these diaspora darlings of the international art scene should be now claimed as China’s own.
These artists’ ability to the bridge traditions of East and West and to create a new space for creativity that can transcend the cultural specificities of the past in favor of a new blended future could be squarely associated with China’s own global aspirations.
Like the artists and their art, the country could elevate itself from the dichotomies of old-new, past-present, and traditional-modern to project an image appropriate to our globalizing age.
Not surprisingly, Chinese leadership was keen to avoid any reference to the last two centuries of struggle and humiliation, or to its problematic political agendas and thorny trade issues.
At the same time, it could be argued that the spectacle of the opening ceremony was intended to overcome China’s historic humiliation by the West and signal a new chapter. The “sleeping dragon,” as Napoleon described China in the early nineteenth century, was now fully awake, ready to charge into the new world.
As in the Tang Dynasty, arts and culture were at center stage, reflecting the country’s economic prowess and political might.
But the extravaganza also left lingering doubts.
Why such a drive to prove to the world that these had to be the very best Olympics ever?
(Chinese authorities even pressed the International Olympic Committee to make such a declaration at the conclusion of the games.)
Some have suggested that the effort suggests a hint of insecurity.
It should also be noted that while Mao was conspicuously absent in the Olympics, his communist legacy was present in subtle ways.
The relentless emphasis on the “harmonious” presence of large groups of performers left no room for individual voices (even the young singer Lin Miaoke, as we now know, didn’t have her own voice).
Ironically, while younger Chinese (products of China’s one-child policy) are obsessed with personal stylistic statements, the drama of the opening ceremony consisted in collective expression at the service of the state.
Chinese intellectuals have always been cognizant of this tension between individual creativity and collective will.
How will the new China balance these two conflicting needs?
As we contemplate the potential arrival of the new Tang Dynasty in China, we should remember the message of the old Tang Dynasty poet, Po Chü-i (772-846 AD):
Sent as a present from Annam,
A red cockatoo.
Colored like the peach-tree blossom,
Speaking with the speech of men.
And they did to it what is always done
To the learned and eloquent.
They took a cage with stout bars
And shut it up inside.
MEXICO CITY – For the next American president, fixing the international mess inherited from the Bush administration will be no simple task.
While Latin America will not be a priority for either an Obama or McCain administration, continuing the United States’ neglect of the last seven years is no longer viable.
Two distinct political/diplomatic challenges stand out: Cuba’s imminent transition or succession crisis, and the continuing ascent of the region’s “two lefts,” one represented by Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez and the other by Brazil’s increasingly influential President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
The next US administration will only prove successful if it grasps that Latin America is living through a moment that combines the best and worst aspects of its history: the fastest economic growth since the 1970’s, with poverty and inequality diminishing, and more democratic and respectful of human rights than ever before, but becoming more politically polarized.
In Cuba, Fidel Castro’s eventual passing from the scene represents an immense challenge.
The US cannot continue with the failed policies of the past half-century.
Demanding a full-fledged democratic transition as a pre-condition for normalizing US-Cuban relations is both unrealistic and unpalatable to Latin America.
Yet the US cannot set aside the question of democracy and human rights in Cuba while it awaits the departure of Fidel’s brother, Raúl.
Realpolitik and fear of another exodus of Cuban refugees across the Florida Straits may tempt the US to pursue a “Chinese” or “Vietnamese” solution to Cuba: normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for economic reform, while leaving the question of internal political change until later.
But the US should not succumb to this temptation.
The US, Canada, Europe, and Latin America have constructed a regional legal framework, which must not be abandoned, to defend democratic rule and human rights in the hemisphere.
Cuba needs to return to the regional concert of powers, but it must accept this concert’s rules.
Holding free and fair elections may not be the primary issue, but nor are they issues that should be shelved in the interests of stability and expediency.
Elections must instead be part of a comprehensive process of normalization: they should neither be a deal-breaker nor a non-issue.
While the US should lift its trade embargo as soon as Cuba’s transition begins, everything else should be conditional on Cuba initiating a process of resolving all outstanding issues.
But Cuba is just part of what might be called Latin America’s “left” problem.
Indeed, much has been written recently about the ascent of the left in Latin America over the past decade.
In fact, there are two lefts in the region: a modern, democratic, globalized and market-friendly left, found in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, parts of Central America, and, up to a point, in Peru; and a retrograde, populist, authoritarian, statist, and anti-American left, found in Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Cuba, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela, and, to a lesser extent, in Argentina, Colombia, and Paraguay.
Some of these “lefts” are in power; some, as in Mexico in its last, disputed presidential election, barely missed conquering it, but may still do so.
Over the past two years, it has become increasingly evident that the “modern” or “soft” left is, all in all, governing well.
The other left has proved to be more extreme and erratic than many anticipated.
The former feels no urge to “export” its “model,” whereas the latter has a strategy and the means to do so.
The retrograde left today can realize Che Guevara’s old dream: not “one, two, many Vietnams,” but “one, two, many Venezuelas,” winning power by the ballot and then conserving and concentrating it through constitutional changes and the creation of armed militias and monolithic parties.
It can finance all of this with the support of Venezuela’s state oil company, implementing social policies that are misguided over the long term but seductive in the short run, especially when carried out by Cuban doctors, teachers, and instructors.
Herein lies a dilemma for the next US president: how to address the clear rift between the two lefts in a way that improves US-Latin American relations, fortifies the modern left, and weakens the retrograde left without resorting to the failed interventionist policies of the past.
The best, strictly Latin America-focused steps, are self-evident, if not easily achievable.
They require strengthening those governments of the modern left, or those of the center or center-right threatened by the old-fashioned left, and simultaneously making it clear to the latter that there is a price to be paid for violating the basic tenets of democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.
Turning its back in the face of such challenges is no longer a viable American option.
Aside from areas of particular concern (oil, arms, guerrillas, drugs), the US needs Latin America dearly nowadays because resistance to it is springing up everywhere, and with greater virulence than at any time since World War II’s end.
The next US president must reinvigorate a relationship that is ready to be substantially transformed for the first time since Franklin Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy of seven decades ago.
PRAGUE: Rebellion by Czech TV journalists against a new director of the publicly-owned Czech TV marks the climax of a ten year battle between two concepts of democracy.
The first concept is represented by former prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the second by President Vaclav Havel.
Klaus sees political parties as the backbone of any democratic system and sees little place for civil society in politics.
He deems the proponents of civil society “elitists” who refuse to be tested at the ballot box and who try to influence politics through informal mechanisms.
President Havel argues that a democracy based only on political parties and basic democratic mechanisms is deformed.
In his view, political parties, although necessary, must be checked by a robust civil society.
If civil society is too weak, parties will seek to dominate institutions that should remain independent.
Over the past ten years President Havel has repeatedly asked the Czechs to be more active and to not let politicians control their lives.
Klaus’s vision of democracy had the upper hand for most of the past decade.
Easily understood, it conformed to patterns of behavior most Czechs acquired during the communist era, when public and private spheres of life were rigidly separated.
True, communism’s fall was brought about by a strong civic movement called “Civic Forum”, but that movement disintegrated once it achieved its goal.
With its passing, people became passive once more.
Klaus and his followers spearheaded the creation of well-functioning, standard political parties.
But in the absence of a strong civil society, those parties monopolized public space, pushing civic activists to the sidelines.
Havel was the first important Czech politician to criticize this trend, warning against excessive partisanship and arguing that political parties would become internally weak but outwardly authoritarian if they did not draw inspiration from a vibrant civil society.
Unfortunately, Havel’s vision of democracy appears complicated when compared to that of Klaus.
In the past, calls for active civic engagement and Havel’s moralistic views left average Czechs cold and alienated political opponents, who accused him of promoting a nonpolitical form of politics.
Prompted by civic passivity, political parties not only came to dominate every aspect of Czech life but engaged in dubious practices that increased cynicism and public passivity.
At the end of 1997, the second Klaus government collapsed under the weight of financial scandals.
Rather than learn from this fiasco, Klaus went on the offensive, claiming that he was a victim of a conspiracy hatched by Havel.
But his party, the Civic Democrats (ODS), lost the June 1998 elections to the Social Democrats (CSSD), whom Klaus vilified before the elections as a threat to democracy.
Soon afterwards, however, the Civic Democrats and the Social Democrats signed the so-called “opposition agreement”, under which Klaus’s party gained important posts and other advantages in exchange for allowing the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Zeman to form a minority government.
Klaus, Zeman and their parties also agreed to work together to limit presidential power and the independence of the Central Bank by changing the Constitution, as well as to change the electoral law in their favor.
Four smaller parties, who allied themselves in a four-party coalition called “4K” objected.
Protests against these political arrangements were criticized by the ODS and CSSD as attempts to undermine their efforts to ensure political stability.
Despite the fact that the opposition agreement boosted the popularity of the unreformed Czech Communists, the determination of the Civic Democrats and Social Democrats to continue dividing the spoils of power remained undiminished.
In the fall of 2000, Czech voters rebuked both parties during regional and Senate elections, with the Social Democrats losing their joint majority in the Senate.
Because the Czech Parliament’s upper house has an absolute veto over constitutional amendments, the opportunity to amend the Constitution was lost.
Loss of control of the Senate also meant that Klaus’s hope to replace Havel as president diminished.
Defeat prompted Klaus and Zeman to try to and gain control over Czech TV by packing its council of overseers with their sympathizers.
Shortly before Christmas, Czech TV’s director, who was resisting political pressure, was replaced by Jiri Hodac, a man with close ties to ODS.
TV journalists rebelled, occupying the station's newsroom.
The protests by artists, intellectuals and opposition politicians that followed were the biggest political upheavals since 1989.
Realizing that the game was lost, the Social Democrats joined with Klaus’s opponents in parliament on January 5th to demand Hodac’s resignation.
Parliament is also working on a new TV law to prevent political parties from politicizing the TV Council.
But political realignment is not the most important news arising from this turmoil.
Of far greater importance is the reawakening of civil society which has, for the first time since 1989, stood up to the political parties to reclaim the public space it relinquished ten years ago.
Equally important is the fact that for the first time since 1989, civil society has found a voice independent of President Havel.
Unrecognized by almost everyone, Czech society has moved beyond Havel and Klaus.
It rejects Klaus’s truncated democracy, and, although it supports (to some extent) Havel’s vision, Havel himself is no longer the motor of civil society in action.
NEW YORK – Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the world is facing another stark choice between two fundamentally different forms of organization: international capitalism and state capitalism.
The former, represented by the United States, has broken down, and the latter, represented by China, is on the rise.
Following the path of least resistance will lead to the gradual disintegration of the international financial system.
A new multilateral system based on sounder principles must be invented.
While international cooperation on regulatory reform is difficult to achieve on a piecemeal basis, it may be attainable in a grand bargain that rearranges the entire financial order.
A new Bretton Woods conference, like the one that established the post-WWII international financial architecture, is needed to establish new international rules, including treatment of financial institutions that are too big to fail and the role of capital controls.
It would also have to reconstitute the International Monetary Fund to reflect better the prevailing pecking order among states and to revise its methods of operation. 
In addition, a new Bretton Woods would have to reform the currency system.
The post-war order, which made the US more equal than others, produced dangerous imbalances.
The dollar no longer enjoys the trust and confidence that it once did, yet no other currency can take its place.
The US ought not to shy away from wider use of IMF Special Drawing Rights.
Because SDRs are denominated in several national currencies, no single currency would enjoy an unfair advantage.
The range of currencies included in the SDRs would have to be widened, and some of the newly added currencies, including the renminbi, may not be fully convertible.  This would, however, allow the international community to press China to abandon its exchange-rate peg to the dollar and would be the best way to reduce international imbalances.
And the dollar could still remain the preferred reserve currency, provided it is prudently managed.
One great advantage of SDRs is that they permit the international creation of money, which is particularly useful at times like the present.
The money could be directed to where it is most needed, unlike what is happening currently.
A mechanism that allows rich countries that don’t need additional reserves to transfer their allocations to those that do is readily available, using the IMF’s gold reserves.
Reorganizing the world order will need to extend beyond the financial system and involve the United Nations, especially membership of the Security Council.
That process needs to be initiated by the US, but China and other developing countries ought to participate as equals.
They are reluctant members of the Bretton Woods institutions, which are dominated by countries that are no longer dominant.
The rising powers must be present at the creation of this new system in order to ensure that they will be active supporters.
The system cannot survive in its present form, and the US has more to lose by not being in the forefront of reforming it.
The US is still in a position to lead the world, but, without far-sighted leadership, its relative position is likely to continue to erode.
It can no longer impose its will on others, as George W. Bush’s administration sought to do, but it could lead a cooperative effort to involve both the developed and the developing world, thereby reestablishing American leadership in an acceptable form.
The alternative is frightening, because a declining superpower losing both political and economic dominance but still preserving military supremacy is a dangerous mix.
We used to be reassured by the generalization that democratic countries seek peace.
After the Bush presidency, that rule no longer holds, if it ever did.
In fact, democracy is in deep trouble in America.
The financial crisis has inflicted hardship on a population that does not like to face harsh reality.
President Barack Obama has deployed the “confidence multiplier” and claims to have contained the recession.
But if there is a “double dip” recession, Americans will become susceptible to all kinds of fear mongering and populist demagogy.
If Obama fails, the next administration will be sorely tempted to create some diversion from troubles at home – at great peril to the world.
Obama has the right vision.
He believes in international cooperation, rather than the might-is-right philosophy of the Bush-Cheney era.
The emergence of the G-20 as the primary forum of international cooperation and the peer-review process agreed in Pittsburghare steps in the right direction.
What is lacking, however, is a general recognition that the system is broken and needs to be reinvented.
After all, the financial system did not collapse altogether, and the Obama administration made a conscious decision to revive banks with hidden subsidies rather than to recapitalize them on a compulsory basis.
Those institutions that survived will hold a stronger market position than ever, and they will resist a systematic overhaul.
Obama is preoccupied by many pressing problems, and reinventing the international financial system is unlikely to receive his full attention.
China’s leadership needs to be even more far-sighted than Obama is.
China is replacing the American consumer as the motor of the world economy.  Since it is a smaller motor, the world economy will grow slower, but China’s influence will rise very fast.
For the time being, the Chinese public is willing to subordinate its individual freedom to political stability and economic advancement.
But that may not continue indefinitely – and the rest of the world will never subordinate its freedom to the prosperity of the Chinese state.
As China becomes a world leader, it must transform itself into a more open society that the rest of the world is willing to accept as a world leader.  Military power relations being what they are, China has no alternative to peaceful, harmonious development.  Indeed, the future of the world depends on it.

It is time for New Year's resolutions, and this year's are obvious.
When the millennium opened, world leaders pledged to seek peace, the end of poverty, and a cleaner environment.
Since then, the world has seen countless acts of violence, terrorism, famine, and environmental degradation.
In 2005, we can begin to change direction.
Knowledge, scientific advance, travel, and global communications give us many opportunities to find solutions for the world's great problems.
When a new disease called SARS hit China last year, the World Health Organization coordinated the actions of dozens of governments, and the crisis was quickly brought under control, at least for now.
When Bill Gates donated $1 billion to bring vaccines to poor children, he made it possible to protect tens of millions of young people from preventable diseases.
When an agricultural research unit called the World Agroforestry Center discovered that a certain tree could help African farmers grow more food, they introduced a new and valuable approach to overcoming Africa's chronic food crisis.
Unfortunately, such examples of international cooperation are as rare as they are impressive.
With our knowledge, science, and technology, the horrendous living conditions of the world's poorest people could be dramatically improved.
Millions of people could be spared malaria, HIV/AIDS, hunger, and life in slums.
The problem is not that we lack good solutions.
The problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice.
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has honored me by making me his Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals and asking me to lead a group of scholars and development experts in identifying practical steps to reach the goals by the target date in 2015.
This effort, known as the UN Millennium Project, will issue its report to Secretary-General Annan on January 17, 2005.
Our study, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals , will be available for free around the world at www.unmillenniumproject.org .
What we learned is easily summarized.
For every major problem - hunger, illiteracy, malnutrition, malaria, AIDS, drought, and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable.
These investments, in turn, would strengthen the private sector and economic growth.
Yet they require global partnership between the rich and poor countries of the world.
Most importantly, the world's richest countries need to do much more to help the poorest countries make use of modern science and technology to solve these great problems.
The US, for example, currently spends around $450 billion each year on its military, but less than $15 billion to help the world's poorest countries fight disease, educate their children, and protect the environment.
This is a mistake, because military approaches alone cannot make America safe.
Only shared prosperity can truly make the planet secure.
The US should be investing much more in peaceful economic development.
Germany, Japan, and several other rich countries are also doing much less than they should - and much less than they promised the poor countries that they would do.
In 2002, all donor countries committed to "make concrete efforts" to reach 0.7% of national income in development aid to poor countries.
Germany, Japan, and the US, among others, remain far below this commitment.
The year 2005 will offer many opportunities for citizens around the world to insist that their leaders keep their Millennium promises.
After our report is issued in January, Secretary-General Kofi Annan will issue a report to the world in the spring, identifying the practical steps that should be taken this year.
Around the same time, an important commission on Africa will issue a report to United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Then, in July, the UK will host the annual G-8 Summit of the rich countries.
Blair has promised that he will make the fight against poverty and long-term climate change the two priorities of the summit.
In September, the world's leaders will reconvene at the UN to decide on their actions during the coming decade.
The rich and powerful nations often declare their leadership in the world.
The US claims that it helps the world fight poverty, but instead spends its money on weapons.
Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world's poorest people.
The world's poorest countries will ask themselves why they should vote for Germany and Japan to have permanent seats on the Security Council if they can't keep their promises.
Nothing would be wiser for the world's rich countries than to fulfill their pledges to the world's poor, hungry and disease-ridden peoples.
Therein lies the path to sustained peace.
2005 is the year that words can become reality, and that the world can begin to fulfill its hopes for our new millennium.
Let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity.
Let us pledge that the rich and powerful should take real actions to help the poor, the weak, and the suffering.
LONDON: A hundred years ago, the humorous English magazine Punch carried a cartoon which depicted a young and nervous curate eating breakfast with his bishop.
He was eating a boiled egg, and clearly not enjoying it.
The bishop enquired: “I say - is your egg all right?” And the curate replies: “My Lord, it is excellent in parts.”
The cartoon caught the English fancy, and created a catch-phrase still in use today, although it is usually misunderstood and misused.
Someone may say: “It’s a bit of a curate’s egg”, when he means that something is a mixture of good and bad.
But of course the point of the original joke was that the curate was just being polite: an egg is either good or bad, and his was bad.
This week’s European Summit at Nice (December 7-9) looks like being a curate’s egg.
The question is, will it be bad all through and a failure?
Or will it be “excellent in parts”?
The probable answer is: both.
It will almost certainly fail to achieve its immediate objectives; but it may open the door to serious progress afterwards.
The ostensible purpose of the summit is to make those changes in the European Union’s decision-making machinery that would enable it to cope with the admission of at least 12 new members, mainly from Central and Eastern Europe.
Everyone knows that these changes ought to be radical, even semi-federal.
At the very least, the coming enlargement will call for much more majority voting in the Council of Ministers, if the Union is not be paralyzed by 27 member states and 27 national vetoes.
But most member states are unwilling to contemplate anything that far-reaching.
The host French, who currently hold the EU Presidency, have listed 50 policy areas where majority voting might be possible.
Every country, however, has special sensitivities: the Germans are unwilling to be outvoted on immigration; the French are unwilling to be outvoted on trade in services; the British are unwilling to be outvoted on taxation.
The cumulative result of all these national objections, is that the Nice summit is likely to see only a modest increase in the potential for majority voting, much smaller than enlargement requires.
A similar reluctance will dominate the rest of the immediate institutional agenda.
In principle, the Commission ought to be slimmed down after enlargement, with fewer Commissioners than member states.
Equally, big member states ought to have more votes in the Council of Ministers, to reflect their greater populations.
Small member states do not like either proposition, because they would lose Commissioners and votes.
On both issues, expect a serious tug-of-war, and any decisions are likely to be half-hearted, or in practice postponed.
Yet, the 15 member states may compensate for their collective failure of nerve by opening up easier options for flexible or multi-speed integration.
This might be a way round the majority voting dilemma, since it would allow groups of member states to cooperate together in particular areas, without waiting for the unanimous agreement of all partners.
Whether this would really be a desirable procedure is hotly debated; but the fact is that multi-speed integration already exists in the sense that Britain and Denmark are not now, and may never be, members of the euro.
If these scraps were to be the sum total of the Nice summit, it will prove unsatisfactory, even a failure.
But the real significance of the meeting may turn out to be, not the limited decisions which the heads of government are able and willing to take this time round, but the opening up, virtually for the first time, of serious discussion about the future direction of the European Union.
One thing that will happen at Nice will be the formal adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
In its present form, this document recapitulates all kinds of rights which EU citizens already enjoy under existing laws; it is not intended to confer any new rights, and it cannot be enforced in the European Court of Justice.
In other words, it is a public relations conjuring trick, designed to make the EU seem more attractive, without actually conferring any real benefits.
Even as a conjuring trick, the Charter could be influential.
For example, Article 2 reads: “Everyone has the right to life.
No one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed.” It seems evident that this principle will be effectively binding on all member states, and all candidates for membership.
The question at Nice will be whether the Charter should be incorporated into the EU Treaties, and thus given the force of law.
Another similar question at Nice will be whether the time has come to simplify the EU Treaties, which are now a confusing jumble of general principles and difficult detail.
Simplification might be intended, at the start, as another conjuring trick: to make the Treaties more comprehensible to voters without changing anything in law.
But it could also become the first, essential step on the road to the drafting of a European constitution.
WASHINGTON, DC – Leaders around the world are vigorously debating the advisability of establishing a no-fly zone to stop the violence unfolding in Libya.
Some cite Bosnia, where NATO took too long to protect civilian populations in the mid-1990’s, as a reason to act.
Others remember Rwanda, where President Bill Clinton later expressed regret for not acting to save innocent lives.
But the stakes in Libya today are more appropriately underscored by the tragedy in southern Iraq in the waning days of the Persian Gulf War 20 years ago.
As coalition forces were routing the Iraqi army in February 1991, President George H.W. Bush encouraged the Iraqi people to “take matters into their hands to force Saddam Hussein the dictator to step aside.”
When Iraqi Shiites, Kurds, and Marsh Arabs rebelled against Hussein, they believed that American forces would protect them against their brutal dictator’s superior firepower.
Instead, when Iraqi attack helicopters and elite troops began butchering their own people, coalition forces were ordered to stand down.
The world watched as thousands of Iraqis were slaughtered.
The situation in Libya today is not identical.
Inspired by events in Tunisia and Egypt, the Libyan people rose up spontaneously against four decades of repression by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.
Still, the specter that haunts me is the same – ordinary people facing off against an autocrat’s airpower and well-armed soldiers, counting on the free world to protect them against massacre after we have applauded and bolstered their bravery with our words.
So far, Qaddafi’s forces have relied on airpower selectively.
But Qaddafi is shrewd.
My fear is that he is either choosing to bleed the opposition to death, rather than invite global action with a broad massacre, or waiting for the world to prove itself unwilling to act – at which point he might well begin killing civilians in large numbers.
We cannot wait for that to happen.
We need to take concrete steps now so that we are prepared to implement a no-fly zone immediately if Qaddafi starts using his airpower to kill large numbers of civilians.
Diplomacy is urgently needed to build broad support for a no-fly zone.
The most important imprimatur should come from the United Nations, where debate should begin immediately over a resolution authorizing a no-fly zone.
China and Russia have expressed reservations.
If the Security Council fails to authorize action, those of us determined to protect Libyan civilians will face a more difficult choice should the violence escalate.
So our diplomatic efforts must extend beyond the UN.
The support of NATO and the African Union are important.
To avoid the perception of NATO or the US attacking another Muslim country, the backing of the Arab world is also needed.
On that front, there are promising signs.
The six Arab countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have called for a UN-imposed no-fly zone.
The Arab League has endorsed a similar proposal.
Muslim countries in particular should support preparations for intervention if the violence spirals out of control.
Qaddafi cannot be allowed to think that he can massacre his people with impunity. And he cannot be free to make those attacks more lethal by using his airpower.
If the UN cannot approve a resolution for implementing a no-fly zone, then the US and its allies in NATO and the Arab world must be prepared to prevent a massacre like the one that occurred in Srebrenica in 1995, when more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were slaughtered.
Of course, imposing a no-fly zone would not be a panacea.
It probably would not tip the balance if the situation in Libya deteriorates into a full-scale civil war.
But a no-fly zone would eliminate airstrikes and save civilian lives.
It is a tool that we should be ready to use if the situation warrants it, and it would signal to the opposition that it is not alone.
Before that decision is reached, the international community needs to provide humanitarian assistance and medical supplies to the rebels in eastern Libya.
We must not allow them to be starved into submission.
The one option that should not be on the table is US ground troops; no one wants to see US forces bogged down in another war, especially in another Muslim country.
And, as President Barack Obama has said, the Libyan people must not be deprived of full ownership of their struggle for freedom, and Qaddafi must not be given a useful foil and scapegoat.
Perhaps the mere threat of a no-fly zone will keep Qaddafi’s pilots from using their helicopters and fighter jets to kill their own people.
If it does not, we should make clear that we will lead the free world to avoid the senseless slaughter of any more Libyan citizens by a madman bent on maintaining power.
The US and the world community should also make clear – as we did in Bosnia and Kosovo – that we are taking a united stand against a thug who is killing Muslims.
LONDON – Earlier this week, a group of almost 100 prominent Europeans delivered an open letter to the leaders of all 17 eurozone countries.
The letter said, in so many words, what the leaders of Europe now appear to have understood: they cannot go on “kicking the can down the road.”
And, just as importantly, they now understand that it is not enough to ensure that governments can finance their debt at reasonable interest rates; they must also address the weakness of Europe’s banking system.
Indeed, Europe’s banking and sovereign-debt problems are mutually self-reinforcing.
The decline in government bond prices has exposed the banks’ undercapitalization, while the prospect that governments will have to finance banks’ recapitalization has driven up risk premiums on government bonds.
Facing the prospect of having to raise additional capital at a time when their shares are selling at a fraction of book value, banks have a powerful incentive to reduce their balance sheets by withdrawing credit lines and shrinking their loan portfolios.
Europe’s leaders are now contemplating what to do, and their next move will have fateful consequences, either calming the markets or driving them to new extremes.
All agree that Greece needs an orderly restructuring, because a disorderly default could cause a eurozone meltdown.
But, when it comes to the banks, I am afraid that the eurozone’s leaders are contemplating some inappropriate steps.
Specifically, they are talking about recapitalizing the banking system, rather than guaranteeing it.
And they want to do it on a country-by-country basis, rather than on the basis of the eurozone as a whole.
There is a good reason for this: Germany does not want to pay for recapitalizing French banks.
But, while Chancellor Angela Merkel is justified in insisting on this, it is driving her in the wrong direction.
Let me stake out more precisely the narrow path that would allow Europe to pass through this minefield.
The banking system needs to be guaranteed first, and recapitalized later.
Governments cannot afford to recapitalize the banks now; it would leave them with insufficient funds to deal with the sovereign-debt problem.
It will cost much less to recapitalize the banks after the crisis has abated and both government bonds and bank shares have returned to more normal levels.
Governments can, however, provide a credible guarantee, given their power to tax.
A new, legally binding agreement – not a change to the Lisbon Treaty (which would encounter too many hurdles), but a new agreement – will be needed for the eurozone to mobilize that power, and such an accord will take time to negotiate and ratify. But, in the meantime, governments can call upon the European Central Bank, which the eurozone member states already fully guarantee on a pro rata basis.
In exchange for a guarantee, the eurozone’s major banks would have to agree to abide by the ECB’s instructions.
This is a radical step, but a necessary one under the circumstances.
Acting at the behest of the member states, the ECB has sufficient powers of persuasion: it could close its discount window to the banks, and the governments could seize institutions that refuse to cooperate.
The ECB would then instruct the banks to maintain their credit lines and loan portfolios while strictly monitoring the risks they take for their own account.
This would remove one of the two main driving forces of the current market turmoil.
The ECB could deal with the other driving force, the lack of financing for sovereign debt, by lowering its discount rate, encouraging distressed governments to issue treasury bills, and encouraging the banks to subscribe (an idea I owe to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa).
The T-bills could be sold to the ECB at any time, making them tantamount to cash; but, as long as they yield more than deposits with the ECB, the banks would find it advantageous to hold them.
Governments could meet their financing needs within agreed limits at very low cost during this emergency period, and the ECB would not violate Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty.
These measures would be sufficient to calm markets and bring the acute phase of the crisis to an end.
Recapitalization of the banks should wait until then; only the holes created by restructuring the Greek debt would have to be filled immediately.
In conformity with Germany’s demand, the additional capital would come first from the market and then from individual governments – and from the European Financial Stability Facility only as a last resort, thereby preserving the EFSF’s firepower.
A new agreement for the eurozone, negotiated in a calmer atmosphere, should not only codify the practices established during the emergency, but also lay the groundwork for an economic-growth strategy.
During the emergency period, fiscal retrenchment and austerity are unavoidable; but, in the longer term, the debt burden will become unsustainable without growth – and so will the European Union itself.
PRAGUE – The global financial crisis may be grabbing all the headlines, but resolving it should not be allowed to crowd out other vital issues.
In the Middle East, for example, Israelis and Palestinians – as well as many others around the world – are beginning to believe that the permanent status negotiations to determine the future of Palestine are going nowhere.
The situation may be more promising than it appears, but one cannot deny that hope for real changes on the ground has faded since talks were re-launched two years ago.
This loss of faith is, sadly, establishing a dynamic that will itself inhibit the concessions that are needed if a permanent agreement is to be found.
Because an impasse beckons, it is vitally important to work on those areas where intensive negotiations have the potential to produce quick results.
Fresh water is one such area.
Across the Middle East, water is a security issue.
Indeed, people are now recognizing two important facts.
First, nations faced with conflicting claims to water have historically found ways to collaborate rather than to fight.
Even during the 60 years of conflict in the Jordan Valley, water has more often been a source of cooperation than of conflict.
Second, water scarcity is seldom absolute, and even less often an explanation of poverty.
To quote the United Nations Human Development Report for 2006: “There is more than enough water in the world for domestic purposes, for agriculture and for industry….Scarcity is manufactured through political processes and institutions that disadvantage the poor.”
But almost every nation in the Middle East is using more water than arrives on a renewable basis.
There simply is not enough water for everything these nations want to use it for, and the situation will only worsen.
Yet, even in Palestine, the key water issue is not thirst, but arrested economic development.
In the short term, Palestine needs more water to provide employment and income from farming; in the longer term, educational, cultural, and political changes are needed in order to develop a capacity to adapt.
The region’s climate and geography mean that water resources are unavoidably shared.
But only if water is shared in a rational manner that respects the region’s fragile ecology will human life be sustainable.
Clearly, no final agreement on water will be possible until there are agreed-upon borders between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, and some resolution of the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
But interim resolution of water issues does not need to wait for final resolution of the major issues.
Finding rational ways to share and co-manage water may be easier than solving the “big” issues.
In fact, water could help to create a climate of success that aids progress in other areas.
The good news is that the quantity of water that is needed for drinking, cooking, other household chores and sanitation is small.
Most water is used to grow food, so, if a nation’s economy is healthy, there is scope for saving water by importing a greater share of food, although every nation will want to maintain some assured food supply for security reasons.
The bad news is that water, unlike land, cannot simply be divided.
Water flows on the surface and underground.
As it moves, it changes in quantity and quality, and it supports different ecosystems.
Moreover, demand for water changes over time.
Only a few percentage points of the Israeli GNP come from agriculture today; as a result, its economy requires less water than it once did.
Exactly the same transition is likely to occur in Palestine, but it has not happened yet.
Few Israelis deny that Palestinians need more water.
Similarly, there is wide agreement that some water currently used by Israelis will have to be allocated to Palestinian use.
The current negotiations will inevitably deal with rights to water, which do not seem to be very contentious anymore, and the talks can suggest various mechanisms for transfer of management in some cases and for shared management in others.
These are eminently negotiable issues.
A flexible and sustainable formula can certainly be found, almost surely including a transitional period that allows both sides to adjust to and account for their different water management systems, as well as for changing conditions and institutions in the future.
The principle of a just division of water resources to meet the Palestinians’ urgent needs for additional water should be taken as a starting point.
Everything else can be worked out.
Shared water calls for flexible, continuous, cooperative water management, based on agreed-upon rights and responsibilities, as well as ongoing monitoring and dispute resolution mechanisms.
One important point should be added: extensive public participation and transparency, in terms of both process and outcomes, will be key to successful management.
We believe that progress in the peace process and in finding solutions for water issues between Israel and Palestine would also help to unblock progress in the broader region, between the parties on the Jordan, the Orontes, the Tigris, and the Euphrates rivers.
Water can be a catalyst for regional cooperation, opening the way to a future comprehensive “Community of Water and Energy” to enhance the human environment.
In such a forum, water and solar energy in tandem could help to move the Middle East from conflict to collaboration.
The cost of inaction or merely pretending to act is likely to be high for everyone in the Middle East.
Future water policy should no longer be seen as an extension of current policy, but rather as a new opportunity.
Water is the essence of life.
People in Palestine and in Israel need it; people in the region need it.
Cooperating to secure it is the only way forward.
NEW HAVEN – We are in the midst of a boom in popular economics: books, articles, blogs, public lectures, all followed closely by the general public.
I recently participated in a panel discussion of this phenomenon at the American Economic Association annual meeting in Denver.
An apparent paradox emerged from the discussion: the boom in popular economics comes at a time when the general public seems to have lost faith in professional economists, because almost all of us failed to predict, or even warn of, the current economic crisis, the biggest since the Great Depression.
So, why is the public buying more books by professional economists?
The most interesting explanation I heard was that economics has become more interesting, because it no longer seems to be a finished and closed discipline.
It is no fun to read a book or article that says that economic forecasting is best left to computer models that you, the general reader, would need a Ph.D. to understand.
And, in truth, the public is right: while there is a somewhat scientific basis for these models, they can go spectacularly wrong.
Sometimes we need to turn off autopilot and think for ourselves, and when a crisis occurs, use our best human intellect.
The panelists all said, in one way or another, that popular economics facilitates an exchange between specialized economists and the broader public – a dialogue that has never been more important.
After all, most economists did not see this crisis coming in part because they had removed themselves from what real-world people were doing and thinking.
Successful popular economics involves the reader or listener, in some sense, as a collaborator.
That, of course, means that economists must be willing to include new and original theories that are not yet received doctrine among professional specialists.
Until recently, many professional economists would be reluctant to write a popular book.
Certainly, it would not be viewed favorably in considering a candidate for tenure or a promotion.
Since it does not include equations or statistical tables, they would argue, it is not serious work that is worthy of scholarly attention.
Worse than that, at least until recently, a committee evaluating an economist would likely think that writing a popular economics book that does not repeat the received wisdom of the discipline might even be professionally unethical.
Imagine how the medical profession would view one of its members who recommended to the general public some therapy that had not yet passed scrutiny from the appropriate authorities.
Medical professionals know how often seemingly promising new therapies turn out, after careful study, not to work, or even to be harmful.
There is a rigorous process of scholarly review of proposed new therapies, associated with professional journals that uphold high research standards.
Circumventing that process and promoting new, untested ideas to the general public is unprofessional.
In the decades prior to the current financial crisis, economists gradually came to view themselves and their profession in the same way, encouraged by research trends.
For example, after 1960, when the University of Chicago started creating a Univac computer tape that contained systematic information about millions of stock prices, a great deal of scientific research on the properties of stock prices was taken as confirming the “efficient markets hypothesis.”
The competitive forces that underlie stock exchanges were seen to force all securities prices to their true fundamental values.
All trading schemes not based on this hypothesis were labeled as either misguided or outright frauds.
Science had triumphed over stock-market punditry – or so it seemed.
The financial crisis delivered a fatal blow to that overconfidence in scientific economics.
It is not just that the profession didn’t forecast the crisis.
Their models, taken literally, sometimes suggested that a crisis of this magnitude couldn’t happen.
One way to interpret this is that the economics profession was not fully accounting for the economy’s human element, an element that can’t be reduced to mathematical analysis.
The relatively few professional economists who warned of the current crisis were people, it seems, who not only read the scholarly economics literature, but also brought into play more personal judgment: intuitive comparisons with past historical episodes; conclusions about speculative trading, price bubbles, and the stability of confidence; evaluations of the moral purposes of economic actors; and impressions that complacency had set in, lulling watchdogs to sleep.
These were judgments made by economists who were familiar with our business leadership – their inspirations, beliefs, subterfuges, and rationalizations.
Their views could never be submitted to a scholarly journal and evaluated the way a new medical procedure is.
There is no established scientific procedure that could prove their validity.
Of course, economics is in many ways a science, and the work of our scholars and their computer models really does matter.
But, as the economist Edwin R. A. Seligman put it in 1889, “Economics is a social science, i.e., it is an ethical and therefore an historical science….It is not a natural science, and therefore not an exact or purely abstract science.”
To me, and no doubt to the other panelists, part of the process of pursuing the inexact aspects of economics is speaking honestly to the broader public, looking them in the eye, learning from them, reading the emails they send, and then searching one’s soul to decide whether one’s favored theory is really close to the truth.
NEW YORK – Where is the American and global economy headed?
Last year, there were two sides to the debate.
One camp argued that the recession in the United States would be V-shaped – short and shallow.
It would last only eight months, like the two previous recessions of 1990-1991 and 2001, and the world would decouple from the US contraction.
Others, including me, argued that, given the excesses of private-sector leverage (in households, financial institutions, and corporate firms), this would be a U-shaped recession – long and deep.
It would last about 24 months, and the world would not decouple from the US contraction.
Today, 20 months into the US recession – a recession that became global in the summer of 2008 with a massive re-coupling – the V-shaped decoupling view is out the window.
This is the worst US and global recession in 60 years.
If the US recession were – as most likely - to be over at the end of the year, as is likely, it will have been three times as long and about fives times as deep – in term of the cumulative decline in output – as the previous two.
Today’s consensus among economists is that the recession is already over, that the US and global economy will rapidly return to growth, and that there is no risk of a relapse.
Unfortunately, this new consensus could be as wrong now as the defenders of the V-shaped scenario were for the past three years.
Data from the US – rising unemployment, falling household consumption, still declining industrial production, and a weak housing market – suggest that America’s recession is not over yet.
A similar analysis of many other advanced economies suggests that, as in the US, the bottom is quite close but it has not yet been reached.
Most emerging economies may be returning to growth, but they are performing well below their potential.
Moreover, for a number of reasons, growth in the advanced economies is likely to remain anemic and well below trend for at least a couple of years.
The first reason is likely to create a long-term drag on growth: households need to deleverage and save more, which will constrain consumption for years.
Second, the financial system – both banks and non-bank institutions – is severely damaged.
Lack of robust credit growth will hamper private consumption and investment spending.
Third, the corporate sector faces a glut of capacity, and a weak recovery of profitability is likely if growth is anemic and deflationary pressures still persist.
As a result, businesses are not likely to increase capital spending.
Fourth, the re-leveraging of the public sector through large fiscal deficits and debt accumulation risks crowding out a recovery in private-sector spending.
The effects of the policy stimulus, moreover, will fizzle out by early next year, requiring greater private demand to support continued growth.
Domestic private demand, especially consumption, is now weak or falling in over-spending countries (the US, the United Kingdom, Spain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, etc.), while not increasing fast enough in over-saving countries (China, Asia, Germany, Japan, etc.) to compensate for the reduction in these countries’ net exports.
Thus, there is a global slackening of aggregate demand relative to the glut of supply capacity, which will impede a robust global economic recovery.
There are also now two reasons to fear a double-dip recession.
First, the exit strategy from monetary and fiscal easing could be botched, because policymakers are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.
If they take their fiscal deficits (and a potential monetization of these deficits) seriously and raise taxes, reduce spending, and mop up excess liquidity, they could undermine the already weak recovery.
But if they maintain large budget deficits and continue to monetize them, at some point – after the current deflationary forces become more subdued – bond markets will revolt.
At this point, inflationary expectations will increase, long-term government bond yields will rise, and the recovery will be crowded out.
A second reason to fear a double-dip recession concerns the fact that oil, energy, and food prices may be rising faster than economic fundamentals warrant, and could be driven higher by the wall of liquidity chasing assets, as well as by speculative demand.
Last year, oil at $145 a barrel was a tipping point for the global economy, as it created a major income shock for the US, Europe, Japan, China, India, and other oil-importing economies.
The global economy, barely rising from its knees, could not withstand the contractionary shock if similar speculative forces were to drive oil rapidly towards $100 a barrel.
So the end of this severe global recession will be closer at the end of this year than it is now, the recovery will be anemic rather than robust in advanced economies, and there is a rising risk of a double-dip recession.
The recent market rallies in stocks, commodities, and credit may have gotten ahead of the improvement in the real economy.
If so, a correction cannot be too far behind.
LONDON – The Greek debt problem has been poorly handled by Europe’s decision-makers.
European Union heads of government, and the European Central Bank, initially rejected the idea of involving the International Monetary Fund, but without a fall-back plan. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that part of the motivation for this was French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s reluctance to see Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF’s managing director, ride in from Washington to the rescue of the eurozone.
Strauss-Kahn is, of course, likely to be Sarkozy’s Socialist rival in the next French presidential election.
Is Greece the “canary in the coalmine” – the warning that tells us that Europe’s monetary union is on the verge of dissolution, with the other three of the famous PIGS (Portugal, Italy, and Spain) lining up like dominoes to fall? George Soros fears this might be the case, and gives the eurozone only a 50% chance of survival in its present form.
Certainly, the episode highlighted flaws in the way the euro’s governance – flaws that are no surprise to some of those involved in creating the common currency.
Helmut Kohl, one of the euro’s principal parents, said in 1991 that “the idea of sustaining an economic and monetary union over time without political union is a fallacy.” Margaret Thatcher, from the opposite camp, said in her memoirs: “I believe the European single currency is bound to fail, economically, politically and indeed socially, although the timing, occasion and consequences are all still unclear.”
There may now be a market for a Greek translation of her book.
Although they might not agree with either of these two apocalyptic predictions, many of Europe’s leaders are coming round to the view that there is a need for change, and that the Greek case has revealed a flaw at the center of the project. Sarkozy, for example, has revived a long-standing French argument for some form of economic government in Europe as a counterweight to the ECB.
The French usually advance this proposal to get some purchase on the ECB’s monetary decisions, which they sometimes consider hostile to growth and employment, or in order to prevent other countries from maintaining unfair tax policies (“unfair” usually being defined as a tax rate lower than the relevant French one).
In the past, the Germans brushed these arguments aside, but now they are a little more receptive. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, however, focuses on the issue of distressed members, and has advanced a proposal for a European Monetary Fund to provide assistance to countries in Greek-style difficulties, roughly on the IMF model.
This idea has logic behind it. The drawback is that it would require a change in the European treaties, which in turn requires a unanimous decision by 27 countries, and positive votes in referendums in some of them, including the United Kingdom if David Cameron’s Conservatives win the upcoming general election there.
In the aftermath of the negative referendum votes in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland on European constitutional reform, it is close to inconceivable that EU heads of government would agree to set off down that path again. Certainly nothing could be achieved on a timetable that would offer any comfort to the other PIGS.
They would all be bacon and sausages before any agreement was reached.
So, in the short run, the IMF will have to be used, if that kind of support is needed, and Sarkozy will have to swallow his pride.
But is an EMF really what is required in the long run?
I think not.
Nor do I think that a European economic government is strictly necessary. What is needed, though, is a collective agreement on fiscal discipline, and a revival of the Stability and Growth Pact, which was unwisely abandoned – ironically when the French and Germans found its rules too constraining.
Europe’s leaders should refer to a paper by Otmar Issing, “The Euro – A Currency Without a State,” published in December 2008, before the debt crisis erupted. Issing, the ECB’s chief economist in its formative years, knows more about how a monetary union operates in practice than any man alive.
He maintains that “the Stability and Growth Pact contains all the rules that are necessary for Monetary Union to function.
There is no need for coordination of macroeconomic policies to go any further than this.”
Europe does not need the French plan for coordination of tax policies, or another IMF, but there does need to be fiscal discipline to prevent other countries from free riding, as the Greeks seem to have done. They apparently assumed that the rest of Europe would overlook continuing high deficits, and that, as eurozone members, the market would consider their debt to be just like German bunds, though issued by friendly and welcoming people in an agreeable climate, and with a glass of ouzo on the side.
The original Pact envisaged a 3%-of-GDP cap on fiscal deficits, save in exceptional circumstances.
Investors well understand that we are in such circumstances now, so it will take some time to get back to that level. But that should be the clear aim, with IMF assistance along the way to provide interim funding where necessary and political cover for governments obliged to take tough decisions on public spending and taxation.
Fiscal discipline does not sound as visionary as “economic government.”
But the EU has suffered from a surfeit of “vision” and a deficit of practical budgetary measures. It is time to redress that balance, or Soros’s gloomy prognosis may become reality.
PRINCETON – On February 1, the United Nations Security Council met to consider the Arab League’s proposal to end the violence in Syria.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton represented the United States.
Midway through her remarks, she began speaking not to the Syrian ambassador, who was in the room, or even the Syrian government, but directly to the Syrian people.
She said that change in Syria would require Syrians of every faith and ethnicity to work together, protecting and respecting the rights of minorities.
Addressing those minorities, she continued: “We do hear your fears, and we do honor your aspirations. Do not let the current regime exploit them to extend this crisis.”
She told Syria’s business, military, and other leaders that they must recognize that their futures lie with the state, not with the regime. “Syria belongs to its 23 million citizens, not to one man or his family.”
Speaking directly to citizens – seeing a country’s people, as well as its government – is not just a rhetorical device.
While many foreign-policy pundits have focused on the US “pivot to Asia,” Clinton has also executed a less-publicized, but no less important, pivot to the people.
She has introduced policies, programs, and institutional reforms designed to support government-to-society and society-to-society diplomacy, alongside traditional government-to-government relations.
These initiatives do not get headlines, but they will gradually transform much of American foreign policy.
In January, the State Department unveiled a new “super-office” of Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, under the leadership of Under-Secretary Maria Otero.
The office brings together agencies that focus on international law enforcement, counter-terrorism, and reconstruction and stabilization with those charged with advancing democracy, human rights, and humanitarian assistance to refugees and migrants.
Otero explains the logic behind the initiative in terms of “protecting individuals.”
That, in turn, requires “not just engaging state to state,” but also working “with players and actors outside of the traditional [channels] we’ve engaged in.”
Viewed from this perspective, countering terrorism includes rebutting terrorist propaganda with a strategic communications campaign.
Countering narco-gang violence includes working with Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim to develop tools that allow ordinary citizens to report violence anonymously by text message and enable police to map the results.
Strengthening democracy means working with the Kenyan developers of a crisis-mapping platform that allows anyone with a cell phone to text information about election fraud or violence to a central monitoring station.
On a country-by-country basis, pivoting to the people means engaging with Egypt’s bloggers as well as with the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces; convening young entrepreneurs in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco and connecting them to funding and mentoring; and using social media in Russia to rebut government efforts to smear the US ambassador.
And, working at an official level, it means co-sponsoring with Brazil the Open Government Partnership, which brings together governments committed to increasing transparency, accountability, and citizen participation, and uses mutual peer pressure and open reporting to hold them to their commitments.
Thinking about countries in these comprehensive terms also provides a different strategic perspective.
Clinton has created a raft of new positions at the State Department to spur outreach to different social segments.
The strategies and programs developed by the Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues, the Special Adviser for Global Youth Issues, the Senior Adviser for Civil Society and Emerging Democracies, the Special Representative for Outreach to Muslim Communities, the Special Representative for Global Partnerships, and the Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs often present a very different face of the US.
As a result, Clinton has launched an actual strategic dialogue with civil society.
For example, Ambassador Melanne Verveer has attended more than 1,000 events around the world focused on empowering women in areas ranging from peace negotiations to farming.
Similarly, she has launched programs such as mWomen, designed to expand and support mobile technology that increases women’s independence, security, and access to health care and vital knowledge.
The Office of Global Youth Affairs is building a local youth council at every US embassy around the world, to advise and help to implement embassy programming aimed at local youth.
Much of the programming aimed at youth, women, entrepreneurs, diasporas, technologists, and other social groups is partly funded and conducted by the private sector.
Indeed, the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy mentions “public-private partnerships” more than 30 times.
Clinton created the Global Partnership Initiative to build as many coalitions, networks, and partnerships as possible with corporations, foundations, NGOs, universities, and other civic organizations.
Here, the pivot to the people includes the American people: the dynamism, creativity, and resources of American business and non-profit organizations already engaged around the world.
One privately-funded initiative spearheaded by the State Department will send 300 dogwood trees to Japan this spring, to be planted in the tsunami-affected region and in Tokyo to express the American people’s support for the Japanese people; another will send English teachers throughout Southeast Asia.
After participating in the Friends of Syria conference in Tunis, Clinton convened a town hall meeting with Tunisian youth.
In her opening remarks, she told her audience that “young people are at the heart of today’s great strategic opportunities and challenges.”
Speaking about her lifetime efforts to put “women’s empowerment on the international agenda,” she added, “It’s time to put youth empowerment there as well.”
The implications of all of this activity, which Clinton calls “twenty-first-century statecraft,” are profound.
From now on, US diplomatic relations with other countries will engage directly with their people and connect them to the American people as much as possible.
From the perspective of US diplomats, the people of every country stand on the same footing as their government.
That assumption is the heart of democracy; it is a revolution for diplomacy.
MELBOURNE – Two new movies released this month – one a science-fiction blockbuster, the other a revealing documentary – raise the issue of our relations with our closest non-human relatives, the great apes.
Both dramatize insights and lessons that should not be ignored.
Rupert Wyatt’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the seventh film in a series based on Pierre Boule’s 1963 novel, Planet of the Apes, about a world populated by highly intelligent simians.
Publicity for the new film claims that it is “the first live-action film in the history of movies to star, and be told from the point of view of, a sentient animal.”
Yet no live apes were used.
Instead, “performance capture technology,” originally invented for the movie Avatar, enables a human actor, Andy Serkis, to play the role of the chimpanzee Caesar, not by dressing in a chimp suit, but by having every gesture and facial movement, even the twitch of an eyebrow, transformed into the movement of an ape.
When I spoke with Wyatt last month, he acknowledged that there were practical reasons for not using real apes in his movie. But he also understood the ethical issue.
“There are things I didn’t want to be involved in,” he told me. “To get apes to do anything you want them to do, you have to dominate them; you have to manipulate them into performing.
That’s exploitative.”
Wyatt’s reluctance to join in the exploitation of great apes is understandable, given that the film itself tells the story of apes rising up in response to oppression from dominant humans.
The central human character, Will Rodman (played by James Franco), is a scientist seeking a cure for Alzheimer’s disease who experiments on apes.
Many films would have glorified a scientist seeking such a goal, and treated the use of animals for that purpose as obviously justified.
Rise of the Planet of the Apes, however, portrays Rodman as, in Franco’s words, “a cold, isolated person.”
Only when Rodman’s superiors cancel his experiments and he takes home Caesar, an infant chimpanzee, does the scientist begin to care about others.
The plot then takes another turn when Caesar becomes too big and aggressive to live in a human home, and is taken to what is supposed to be a primate sanctuary, but is in fact a dumping ground for unwanted apes, run by humans who display cruelty to the captive animals.
As far as the treatment of apes is concerned, much of the film is firmly grounded in reality, as a viewing of Project Nim, a documentary based on Elizabeth Hess’s book Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would be Human, clearly demonstrates.
Nim was born in 1973, in a primate research facility in Oklahoma, and was taken from his mother when he was only ten days old, to be used in a sign-language experiment.
Reared as part of a human family, he learned to use more than 100 signs from American Sign Language, the language used by Deaf Americans.
But he was taken from his first human family and handed over to other teachers with whom he did not have the same kind of bond.
He grew stronger and more aggressive and began biting his teachers.
Herbert Terrace, the Columbia University psychologist who was directing the project, decided to end it and sent Nim back to the primate facility in Oklahoma.
There, the pampered chimpanzee – who, when asked to sort photos of humans and apes, put his own photo among the humans – was locked in a cage with other chimps.
He demonstrated his view of that situation by signing “out” to passing humans.
Nim suffered various other vicissitudes – and narrowly escaped being infected with hepatitis as part of a medical experiment – until he was eventually released to an animal sanctuary, where he died in 2000.
In 1993, Paola Cavalieri and I founded The Great Ape Project, an organization dedicated to the idea of recognizing that great apes have a moral status befitting their nature as self-aware beings who are capable of thought and have rich and deep emotional lives.
At a minimum, they should have the rights to life, liberty, and protection from torture that we grant to all members of our own species, regardless of their intellectual abilities.
In the intervening years, that idea has made steady progress.
Since 2010, the European Union has essentially banned the use of great apes in experiments.
Experiments on great apes are now either banned or severely restricted in New Zealand, Australia, and Japan.
In the United States, a bipartisan group of members of Congress is supporting legislation to end the use of chimpanzees in invasive research.
In Spain in 2008, a parliamentary resolution urged the government to grant some basic legal rights to great apes, but the Spanish government has yet to implement it.
Perhaps the release of these two very different films will lead to a further push to bring great apes within the circle of beings with moral and legal rights.
In that way, our closest relatives could serve to bridge the moral gulf that we have dug between ourselves and other animals.
NEW YORK – In a way, the stir aroused by the decision by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to indict Sudan’s President Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur is a surprise.
After all, the Court has no means of its own to arrest anyone in Sudan, much less a head of state who commands the country’s armed forces.
Nor is there any prospect that someone else will intervene in Sudan to make an arrest.
While the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, expresses confidence that Bashir will be brought to justice, it is unclear how this will happen.
But it could.
Despite the ICC’s seeming powerlessness, many governments’ leaders are engaged in strenuous efforts to block the indictment.
They do not seem concerned that the charges are unfair; rather, they appear to be demonstrating solidarity with a fellow head of state. 
Those denouncing the attempt to put Bashir on trial include the large blocs of countries that are members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the African Union, together with such powerful states as China and Russia.
One can only guess whether some of those joining this effort are motivated by concern that they themselves may some day face charges like those leveled at Bashir by the ICC judges.
Though Bashir may be able to avoid arrest simply by limiting his international travel, the commotion provoked by the indictment is not irrational.
The charges against him have a powerful stigmatizing effect.
The fact that a panel of judges representing the 108 governments that are parties to the ICC has accused Bashir of principal responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur during the past six years undermines the legitimacy of his continued rule.
Those crimes have caused more than 300,000 deaths, and have forcibly displaced at least another 2.7 million people.
Even if Bashir’s fellow heads of state succeed in their effort to persuade the United Nations Security Council to defer prosecution – which is highly unlikely – the charges will continue to hang over Bashir’s head unless and until he stands trial.
In 1999, an international criminal tribunal indicted another sitting head of state, Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Though he seemed secure at the time, a year and a half later he was sent to The Hague to stand trial.
Similarly, in 2003, an international criminal tribunal indicted Liberia’s then president, Charles Taylor.
He had to flee Liberia a few months later and initially received asylum in Nigeria, but is now on trial in The Hague.
When those indictments were issued, no one could have predicted how events would unfold; in retrospect, it is evident that the indictments’ delegitimizing effects had important consequences.
Of course, the ICC’s prosecutor and judges are themselves taking a substantial risk in the indictment of Bashir.
The Court is still in its infancy, and antagonizing the many government leaders expressing solidarity with him could jeopardize its future. 
Yet it should be recognized that the Court’s personnel are carrying out their duties.
The treaty establishing the ICC explicitly states that heads of state do not enjoy immunity.
And the Security Council referred the Darfur case to the Court in 2005.
This was an investigation that had to be conducted, and those found to have the highest level of responsibility for the crimes had to be indicted.
Many of those now objecting to the prosecution of Bashir participated in the decisions leading to the indictment.
If the ICC’s indictment now causes them discomfort, that is only because they did not anticipate that the Court would carry out the responsibilities that they themselves assigned to it.
A few times each year, the world is reminded that a pandemic threat is immanent.
In 2003, it was SARS.
Today, it is a potential avian virus similar to the one that killed 30 million people after 1914.
“Bird flu” has already shown that it can jump from fowl to humans, and now even to cats, which indicates that it might be the next global killer.
But there are many other potential pandemics, and many are not even viruses.
Bacteria, prions, parasites, and even environmental factors could suddenly change in a way that slays us.
It is widely predicted that when this happens, the economic and human losses will exceed that of any previous war.
Indeed, it is humbling to remember that some of history’s most deadly invasions were carried out by single-cell organisms, such as cholera, bubonic plague, and tuberculosis.
Countries with the resources to do so are making resistance plans against pandemics – limited strategies that would protect their own citizens.
Most governments are hoping that early detection will make containment possible.
Containment depends heavily on vaccines, but vaccines are only part of the answer.
While they are a good defense against many viruses, each vaccine is highly specific to the threat.
Viruses are parasites to cells, and each virus attacks a particular type of cell.
The virus is shaped so that it can drill into a particular feature of that cell and inject parts of itself inside, confusing the cell into making more viruses and destroying itself in the process.
With their very specific forms, the most effective anti-viral vaccines must be designed for a narrow range of factors.
Sometimes the tailored nature of viruses works in our favor.
For example, they usually find it difficult to jump between species, because they would have to change their structure.
But if large numbers of a host – say, birds – encounter a great number of people, eventually the virus will find a way to prosper in a new type of cell.
Birds are the greatest concern today only because the spread is easy to see.
But AIDS jumped from monkeys and several types of flu jumped from swine.
Deadly mutations of any kind need to be identified urgently, so that an effective vaccine can be designed before the strain becomes comfortable in the human body.
Unfortunately our present methods of detection are not sensitive enough.
This is even more worrying when you realize that scientists should also be monitoring bacteria, prions, and parasites.
There are more bacteria than any other life form.
Many live harmlessly in our bodies and perform useful functions.
They evolve and adapt easily, which means that they learn to sidestep our drugs over time.
Bacteria should be checked for two types of mutation: adaptation by a hostile form that enables it to become super-immune to drugs, or a deadly mutant strain that appears in one of the multitude of “safe” bacteria.
Prions are a relatively new discovery.
They are made from proteins similar to those that the body uses during healthy operations, which means that they are able to fool the body’s tools into making more prions.
They have only recently been recognized as the cause of several infectious diseases, including mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which kill by crowding out healthy brain cells.
Many nerve, respiratory and muscle diseases might also be caused by prions.
Finally, parasites, simple animals that infect us, are already classified as pandemics.
Malaria afflicts 300 million people and is the world’s biggest killer of children.
Many parasites are worms: hookworm (800 million people infected), roundworm (1.5 billion), schistosomes (200 million), and the worm that causes Elephantiasis (150 million).
There are also antagonists that are currently ignored.
Environmental chemicals and particulates might warrant their own categories.
Or consider combinations of problems, such as these chemical infectors mixing with airborne pollens, and apparently pushing up incidences of asthma.
New fungal infections are even scarier and might be harder to treat.
The bottom line is that we can’t predict where the threat will emerge, so we need a distributed, intelligent detection system.
In practical terms, how should it be built?
“Detectors” would have to be expert enough to know when an ordinary-looking symptom is actually an emergency.
They would be located everywhere, with an emphasis on vulnerable regions.
Initial warning signs of a pandemic are most likely to appear in the developing world, but detection nodes should be positioned in every country, with the least possible expense.
This is not as difficult as it sounds.
The key is to harness existing infrastructure.
Medical infrastructure exists everywhere, in some form.
It also tends to be the least corrupt of institutions in regions where that is a problem.
Medical centers and clinics would be expected to investigate the cause of ailments in a large number of their patients, even in cases where the symptoms seem common.
A small amount of additional scientific expertise and lab equipment would need to be added to a public health system that serves ordinary needs.
Enhancing existing resources would be effective for two reasons.
First, illness is more likely to be reported in a city hospital than at a specialist institute.
Second, the investment would boost latent public health in that region.
For poor regions, investment in equipment and training would have to come from wealthier counterparts.
Rich countries could justify the expense in terms of the savings that would result from early detection of a major threat.
Tropical climates and urban slums are humanity’s front line against pandemics, and they should be equipped properly.
Public health is an important asset for any nation.
With so much at stake, it makes sense to place sentinels near every swamp, city, public market, and farmyard on earth.
Can a public figure have a private life?
Recent events in three countries have highlighted the importance of this question.
In the French presidential election, both candidates tried to keep their domestic life separate from their campaign.
Ségolène Royal is not married to François Hollande, the father of her four children.
When asked whether they were a couple, Royal replied, “Our lives belong to us.” Similarly, in response to rumors that President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy’s wife had left him, a spokesman for Sarkozy said, “That’s a private matter.”
The French have a long tradition of respecting the privacy of their politicians’ personal lives, and French public opinion is more broad-minded than in the United States, where an unwed mother of four would have no chance of being nominated for the presidency by a major party.
Indeed, last month, Randall Tobias, the top foreign aid adviser in the US State Department, resigned after acknowledging that he had used an escort service described as providing “high-end erotic fantasy” – although Tobias said he only had a massage.
In Britain, Lord John Browne, the chief executive who transformed BP from a second-tier European oil company into a global giant, resigned after admitting he had lied in court about the circumstances in which he had met a gay companion (apparently, he met him through a male escort agency).
In resigning, he said that he had always regarded his sexuality as a personal matter, and he was disappointed that a newspaper – The Mail on Sunday – had made it public.
Candidates for public office, and those holding high administrative or corporate positions, should be judged on their policies and performance, not on private acts that are irrelevant to how well they carry out, or will carry out, their public duties.
Sometimes, of course, the two overlap. The Mail on Sunday and its sister paper, The Daily Mail, justified their publication of revelations by Browne’s former companion on the grounds that they include allegations that Browne had allowed him to use corporate resources for the benefit of his own private business.
The company denied that there was any substance to these allegations.
As the administrator of the US Agency for International Development, Tobias implemented the Bush administration’s policy that requires organizations working against HIV/AIDS to condemn prostitution if they are to be eligible for US assistance.
That policy has been criticized for making it more difficult to assist sex workers who are at high risk of contracting and spreading HIV/AIDS.
Arguably, the public has an interest in knowing if those who implement such policies are themselves paying for sexual services.
Where there is no suggestion that a matter of personal morality has had an impact on the performance of a business executive or government official, we should respect that person’s privacy.
But what about candidates for political leadership?
Since politicians ask us to entrust them with sweeping powers, it can be argued that we should know as much as possible about their morality.
For example, we might reasonably ask whether they pay their fair share of taxes, or inquire about their charitable donations.
Such things tell us something about their concern for the public good.
Similarly, the revelation three years ago that the then-Australian opposition leader and aspiring prime minister, Mark Latham, had assaulted a taxi driver and broken his arm in a dispute about a fare was relevant for those who believe that a nation’s leader should be slow to anger.
But does the legitimate interest in knowing more about a politician extend to details about personal relations?
It is hard to draw a line of principle around any area and determine if knowledge of it will provide relevant information about a politician’s moral character.
The problem is that the media have an interest in publishing information that increases their audience, and personal information, especially of a sexual nature, will often do just that.
Even so, whether people choose to marry or not, whether they are heterosexual or homosexual, even whether they pay to fulfill their erotic fantasies or have fantasies they can fulfill at no cost, tells us little about whether they are good people who can be trusted with high office – unless, of course, they say one thing while doing another.
If we can cultivate a wider tolerance of human diversity, politicians, business leaders, and administrators would be less fearful of “exposure,” because they would realize that they have done nothing that they must hide.
Prostitution is illegal in most of the US, including Washington DC, and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign.
But when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month, it became known that he violated his own state’s law by not wearing his seat belt.
By any sensible measure, Corzine’s violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias.
Laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts save many lives.
Laws prohibiting prostitution do no evident good at all, and may well do harm.
Yet no one suggested that Corzine should resign because of his foolish and illegal act.
In the US, at least, breaching sexual norms still brings with it a moral opprobrium that is unrelated to any real harm it may do.
WARSAW: The thirteen days that Pope John Paul II spent in Poland this summer will probably be the last that he ever spends in his homeland.
What the Pope wanted to say to the Polish people, and what was understood by them appear, as the nostalgic haze of that journey fades, to have been two very different things.
Pope John Paul II began his pilgrimage in Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity, with a remembrance mass for St. Adalbert, who introduced Poland to Catholicism some thousand years ago.
St. Adalbert's evangelism is often called the "baptism of Poland".
What the Pope sought, indeed, was nothing less than a re-baptism of our country.
In a way, he treated Poland – up to a point – as a pagan country.
His numerous sermons and speeches revealed his intention to restore Adalbert's spirit in Poland.
John Paul spoke constantly of the need for love, about the love of God, but also about love between people.
In an unprecedented visit to Poland's parliament -- indeed, his address to the Sejm was the first address to a democratic assembly John Paul II has given in the two decades of his papacy -- he even spoke about love between politicians, although he is clever enough to know that such a thing is practically impossible.
Our politicians were happy to hear that they should love each other, though when Pope left they started to quarrel about the meaning of love.
On the last day of his stay, the Pope invited the Polish President, a man with a long communist past, into the "papamobile", which also was totally unprecedented.
So, what was the meaning of the Pope's sermons and this behavior?
First, we can quote the sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf, who often says that democracy and free markets are cold things.
The Pope wanted to show that democracy can be warmed by love, or at least by the fact that real human beings participate in the making of democracy and in the free market.
What was very surprising, particularly given his finger-wagging visits to America and other rich democracies, was that the Pope did not criticize the Polish people for their robust materialism.
In a sense, John Paul II accepted Poland as it is with the hope that people will find more pleasure in democracy and in the free market when they love each other.
Secondly, the Pope recognized the most important problem of Poland and many other young democracies -- the collapse, in the face of material prosperity, of the sense of community.
Even the strongest and most important community in Poland, namely the national community, appears imperilled.
Individualism is of course a part of liberalism and Polish society is now a very liberal one, but some community feelings are necessary for free individuals to exist.
Without a sense of civic and political community, democracy becomes a hollow shell of itself, and can become dangerous as it is no longer controlled by rooted values.
But community cannot be created merely because of common interests.
As Alexis de Tocqueville taught us, community must be a community of values and of patterns of behaviour.
A community based on love need not be a society where people behave like angels.
What the Pope envisioned was a society which is not based on total lack of interest in "thy neighbor", a society of lonely grasping, but containing a certain amount of loyal, reliable friendship.
During the Pope's visit, Poles really loved each other and loved the fact that they belonged to a community, but a very short lived community of those who go to papal masses.
In the weeks since John Paul's plane left Krakow, it is clear that Poles have forgotten everything and things go on as before.
Which means they go as in a cold democracy and a brutally cold free market.
Why is this so?
Evangelical values mean little to people whose only purpose is money.
Even freedom, which in theory is important for the members of a liberal society, is not much valued in Poland.
Democracy in Poland, and probably in all postcommunist countries, was, is, and shall be the freedom to gain money.
One can argue that such is state of affairs elsewhere, but I do not think so.
In some countries, democracy is connected with values which support the welfare state or a society that takes care of its members most of the time.
This is often called "inclusion".
Inclusion in Poland is of no interest to politicians and to businessman, and love, in the Pope's words, was a form of inclusion.
Some months ago Poland faced a wave of peasant strikes.
Farmers sought more money, of course, but what they really wanted was inclusion.
Since 1989 none of the many Polish governments, which nearly always included the Peasant party (PSL), has shown any interest in a group that constitutes 38% of society.
I do not intend to praise communism, but before the Second World War 20% of university students were the offspring of peasants; now we have barely 1%.
No one tries to help young people from the provinces go to high schools and afterward to universities.
Peasants simply cannot manage in the cold free market.
So they feel utterly disconnected from the process of transformation.
Perhaps democracy must be cold as a technique of government but it cannot be cold towards its citizens.
Adam Smith, indeed, was not a theorist of the cold free market, but one of the greatest moralists of the Enlightenment.
The Pope was, therefore, right when he called for more love and was wrong when he hoped that people would listen.
Perhaps, after the first brutal generation of democratic rule, a slightly more moral society will arise and the Pope's words will be recalled from a distance.
Now they are ignored as we, solitarily, grub for the rewards of our material freedom.
MOSCOW: Vladimir Putin has more to celebrate than his election as Russia’s president in his own right.
After a decade of horrific turmoil, Russia’s economy is at last turning around.
Recently, the Moscow brokers Brunswick Warburg predicted that Russia’s GDP will surge 5% this year.
That growth should give President Putin - if he is patient and persistent - leeway to tackle the longer term reforms his country needs if it is to become the powerful state he seeks it to be.
Until now, a broad consensus forecast 1-2% growth in Russia this year.
The reason behind that uninspiring consensus is simple: people - economists and investors alike - have become so pessimistic about Russia that they no longer can see positive facts.
The conventional wisdom is that Russian industrial growth is only an effect of high oil prices and import substitution, facilitated by a great devaluation of the ruble.
Considering that Russia’s growth was 3.2% last year, a staggering 8.8% in the last quarter, this makes little sense.
Growth, indeed, is accelerating.
Dynamism like this does not stop without a major shock.
Industrial growth was 8.1% last year, and has accelerated since, to 14% in February.
Oil and gas have not led the recovery; indeed, they stagnated last year.
Major industries with 16-22% growth were chemicals, light manufacturing, pulp and paper, and machine building; that is, intermediary goods and simple manufacturing, exactly the kind of industries economists like to see expanding at this stage of a recovery.
Within each industry, the best enterprises dash ahead, as should be the case when real restructuring is taking place.
Another tired argument is that Russia’s growth is superficial and not generated by investment.
However, recovery in transition economies from Estonia to Poland to Hungary is usually export led.
Investments tend to follow recovery, as there is so much underutilized capital around.
Even so, investment actually increased by 6% in 1999 and is rising further.
But the most over-hyped argument concerns Russia’s feeble tax collection.
But this obscures the real issue, which is excessive government expenditures.
Last year the government put its finances in order by cutting wasteful and corrupt expenditures, such as enterprise subsidies.
The total government budget deficit stopped at 1.7% of GDP.
This year it will be nearly eliminated.
Barter and arrears (ie, debts between factories and firms), long major concerns, are also diminishing.
Since the financial crash of August 1998 all kinds of arrears have fallen by two/thirds in real terms and barter by half.
One reason was that in 1999 almost 10,000 loss-making Russian enterprises were put into bankruptcy.
The financial crash introduced hard budget constraints on Russian enterprises; they realized they had to make money, prompting rapid monetization.
Today, we are seeing the structural changes that we had hoped to see years ago.
Russia is getting some return from the substantial structural reforms it has actually undertaken.
The last real worry was the foreign balance.
Russia has a substantial foreign debt service, but the recent London Club deal reduced Soviet-era debt to commercial banks by half, easing the pressure mightily.
A similar deal is likely in the Paris Club for the regulation of debts to governments.
During the last few months Russia’s international reserves have grown sharply, as one would expect of a country with a staggering trade surplus of $33 billion this year and which is likely to surge to over $40 billion this year.
Of course, Russia is still hemorrhaging money.
But the cause of Russia’s so-called capital flight is a poor bank system and its dysfunctional tax system.
Fortunately, Russia now has such liberal currency regulations that Russians can keep their money in good international banks instead.
All of these changes mark the beginning of the end of the era of the oligarchs, ushered in with the presidential elections of 1996.
Mr. Putin has no need for the oligarchs to provide him with media support to avert a communist threat or offer a conduit for covert state financing.
To him, Boris Berezovsky and his cronies are a nuisance; most are already been broken to Putin’s will.
Instead, a new group of Russian businessmen, mainly manufacturers, are rising.
Their increasing strength is a reflection of robust economic growth, which promotes production for the market rather than sheer redistribution of resources, implying a new sort of politics.
Last October, McKinsey Global Institute published a major empirical report of Russian industry.
Its conclusion was that Russia had real and human capital suitable to sustain a growth rate of 8% a year, and that its problem was primarily the distortions imposed by a poorly functioning tax system and the absence of a land market.
However, neither the bank system nor the legal system were actually impediments at this stage of development.
They will become important as Russia moves to the next stage of growth, and so these new businessmen are demanding these reforms.
Mr. Putin is no great thinker or reformer, but he is astute and genuinely popular.
He is likely to surf on the current wave of economic growth, using broad consensus about the need for reform to clean up the state administration, and liberalize a tax regime which, though grossly inefficient, is heavy-handed when it goes after a company.
Land reform remains so controversial he may shrink from addressing the issue.
My greatest worry is not Putin but that Russia will face an excessive inflow of foreign portfolio investment again, as in 1997.
Fortunately, the bond markets are dead, and it might take a year to revive them.
Their absence makes it difficult to invest too large amounts of money in Russian securities.
Something fundamental has changed in the Russian economy.
A time comes when all disasters have occurred and all stupidities are recognized.
For Russia, August 1998 marked that dividing line.
It was a horrendous shock, imposing great social costs, but it changed Russia’s mentality, not only the exchange rate.
SYDNEY – Spectators at February’s Daytona 500 in Florida were handed green flags to wave in celebration of the news that the race’s stock cars now use gasoline with 15% corn-based ethanol.
It was the start of a season-long television marketing campaign to sell the merits of biofuel to Americans.
On the surface, the self-proclaimed “greening of NASCAR” (National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) is merely a transparent (and, one suspects, ill-fated) exercise in an environmental form of whitewashing for the sport – call it “greenwashing.”
But the partnership between a beloved American pastime and the biofuel lobby also marks the latest attempt to sway public opinion in favor of a truly irresponsible policy.
The United States spends about $6 billion a year on federal support for ethanol production through tax credits, tariffs, and other programs.
Thanks to this financial assistance, one-sixth of the world’s corn supply is burned in American cars.
That is enough corn to feed 350 million people for an entire year.
Government support of rapid growth in biofuel production has contributed to disarray in food production.
Indeed, as a result of official policy in the US and Europe, including aggressive production targets, biofuel consumed more than 6.5% of global grain output and 8% of the world’s vegetable oil in 2010, up from 2% of grain supplies and virtually no vegetable oil in 2004.
This year, after a particularly bad growing season, we see the results.
Global food prices are the highest they have been since the United Nations started tracking them in 1990, pushed up largely by increases in the cost of corn.
Despite the strides made recently against malnutrition, millions more people will be undernourished than would have been the case in the absence of official support for biofuels.
We have been here before.
In 2007 and 2008, the swift increase in biofuel production caused a food crisis that incited political instability and fueled malnutrition.
Developed countries did not learn.
Since 2008, ethanol production has increased by 33%.
Biofuels were initially championed by environmental campaigners as a silver bullet against global warming.
They started to change their minds as a stream of research showed that biofuels from most food crops did not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and in many cases, caused forests to be destroyed to grow more food, creating more net carbon-dioxide emissions than fossil fuels.
Some green activists supported mandates for biofuel, hoping they would pave the way for next-generation ethanol, which would use non-food plants.
That has not happened.
Today, it is difficult to find a single environmentalist who still backs the policy.
Even former US Vice President and Nobel laureate Al Gore – who once boasted of casting the deciding vote for ethanol support – calls the policy “a mistake.”
He now admits that he supported it because he “had a certain fondness for the [corn] farmers in the state of Iowa” – who, not coincidentally, were crucial to his 2000 presidential bid.
It is refreshing that Gore has now changed his view in line with the evidence.
But there is a wider lesson.
A chorus of voices from the left and right argue against continued government support for biofuel.
The problem, as Gore has put it, is that “it’s hard once such a program is put in place to deal with the lobbies that keep it going.”
Politicians can’t stop such rent-seeking behavior.
What they can do is craft well-considered policies that maximize social welfare.
Unfortunately, when it comes to policies marketed as reining in global warming, protecting the environment, or creating “green jobs,” we have a tendency to make hasty decisions that don’t pass the test.
Government support for biofuel is only one example of a knee-jerk “green” policy that creates lucrative opportunities for a self-interested group of businesses but does very little to help the planet.
Consider the financial support afforded early-generation renewable-energy companies.
Germany led the world in putting up solar panels, funded by $75 billion in subsidies.
The result?
Inefficient, uncompetitive solar technology sitting on rooftops in a fairly cloudy country, delivering a trivial 0.1% of Germany’s total energy supply, and postponing the effects of global warming by seven hours in 2100.
Given the financial stakes, it is little wonder that alternative-energy companies, “green” investment firms, and biofuel producers are lobbying hard for more government largesse, and marketing their cause directly to the public by highlighting its supposed benefits for the environment, energy security, and even employment – none of which withstand scrutiny. “The NASCAR deal will push American ethanol into the stratosphere,” declared Tom Buis, CEO of the ethanol trade association Growth Energy.
At least one group is already sold: presidential contenders.
In Iowa last month, possible Republican candidate Newt Gingrich derided “big-city attacks” on ethanol subsidies.
And, in what must be music to the industry’s ears, an Obama administration official declared that even amidst the highest food prices the world has seen, there is “no reason to take the foot off the gas” on biofuel.
In fact, there are millions of reasons – all of them suffering needlessly – to apply the brakes.
Argentina's president, Eduardo Duhalde, has been making impassioned pleas for international support to rebuild his country.
Argentina needs and deserves such help, and the foundations for economic success-skills (a literate and well-educated population) and institutions (a federal constitutional democracy)-have been in place for a long time.
But Mr Duhalde has yet to specify what must be done to take advantage of Argentina' favorable endowments.
He does at least recognize that only Argentina is responsible for the bad policy choices that led to today's morass.
No one forced Argentina to adopt the currency board devised by Domingo Cavallo, the former economy minister, which pegged the peso to the dollar at a fixed exchange rate of one to one.
(The IMF, however, clearly should not have helped finance the currency board's operation without demanding fiscal adjustment when the country liberalized its foreign trade.)
As a result of the currency peg, Argentina's interest rates were largely determined in the US.
Lacking access to basic economic tools such as exchange rate and monetary policies, Argentina could not surmount the profound external shocks of the second half of the 1990s, when export prices fell, the US dollar appreciated, and Brazil, the country's main trading partner, devalued its currency.
The only alternative was severe fiscal austerity, for which the government never mustered the political will.
Argentina is now in a deep recession, with unemployment above 30%, and a shattered banking and financial system.
Fiscal austerity and balanced budgets should be priorities in the longer term, but they are inappropriate now.
The first priority should be boosting employment to enable citizens to put food on the table and recover a basic sense of confidence in the future.
Otherwise, the country's impoverishment will continue to deplete its middle class and lead many young and capable professionals to emigrate.
It will also sustain unprecedented levels of violence and criminality-another crucial dimension of today's insecurity.
To jump-start the economy, the government must promote exports, particularly in the manufacturing and agro-industrial sectors, as well as tourism and infrastructure construction projects.
After all, there can be no reliance on domestic consumption or private investment to turn the tide.
Higher exports will also generate the foreign exchange needed to resume external debt payments, now in default.
But Argentina's exporters will need help in returning to foreign markets, such as removal of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers by rich countries.
The country has already shown that under favorable conditions its exports can compete and grow rapidly.
According to World Bank data, 32% of Argentina's exports are manufactured goods, with roughly one-quarter classified as high-technology products.
From 1991 to 2001, total exports grew from about $12 billion to $27 billion (an average annual growth rate of about 8.5%), despite the overvalued currency.
President Duhalde has specifically requested the help of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Such assistance should be forthcoming, and in order to avoid bureaucratic overlap and turf conflicts, the responsibilities and priorities in dispensing it should be spelled out and agreed upon in advance by the government and these organizations.
Specifically, the IMF should be responsible for advice related to overall macroeconomic policy, as well as for assembling the financial package required to support the government while it implements its program of economic reactivation and reform of the financial sector.
The IMF should also provide technical and financial assistance to support a long-term program aimed at redefining the fiscal responsibility of the central and provincial governments.
True fiscal decentralization must take hold if the central government is ever to regain full control of public finances.
The World Bank should provide technical and financial assistance to support a reorganized judiciary.
This must include making the appointment of federal and Supreme Court judges free from nepotism and political influence.
A shameful legacy of President Menem's government in the 1990s was that it prevented the investigation and prosecution of serious improprieties, corruption, illegal arms sales, and major terrorist acts.
Finally, the Inter-American Development Bank should assist with programs designed to promote and finance industrial exports, as well as underwriting tourism projects.
These are areas in which the Bank has substantial experience in Latin America.
Argentina deserves the international support it is requesting.
At a time of deep recession, such support should not be made contingent on reaching unattainable fiscal objectives.
Fiscal consolidation should be a condition for the longer-term aid that international organizations will have to provide.
But the first priority must be putting people back to work.
Addressing the glaring shortcomings in the country's judicial system should also be made a condition for support, both as an immediate and a long-term objective.
Under any economic circumstances, denial of justice, and poor implementation of the country's laws, must be remedied as quickly as possible.
For, at the most fundamental level, what is at stake in Argentina is not merely the health of the economy, but the quality of its civil society.
The assassination of the President of Iraq's Governing Council makes it crystal clear that the US is failing to create the minimal law-and-order needed for any sort of orderly transfer of power to take place by June 30th.
Barely two months ago, the signing of a constitutional document by a US-appointed group of un-elected Iraqi officials was heralded as if it were the re-enactment of America's constitutional convention in Philadelphia in 1787.
But by now it is clear that this is a worthless piece of paper.
No imposed constitution, however elegant it may be, will be very helpful to Coalition forces when confronted with the type of mayhem seen in towns like Fallujah or Najjaf.
In the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, however, the situation is completely different: in the last ten years, under the protection of the Allies' no-fly zone, and even more so since the toppling of Saddam, the Kurdish regional government has been able to establish and sustain a relatively orderly administration.
It has overcome tribal and party differences and created ade facto functioning government, with an impressive record on development issues such as education, irrigation, and construction - and, above all, with no violence.
Confronted with the debacle in the rest of (Arab) Iraq, the question has to be asked why the US-led coalition should not hold a referendum in the Kurdish region, asking the population how they would like to be ruled.
After all, the Kurds have, by any internationally accepted standards, a right to self-determination.
Historically, the Kurds - who are distinct in language, culture, and historical consciousness from Arabs - never had their day in court.
After World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Allies promised them a state of their own - a promise that was cynically betrayed when British and French imperial interests took precedence.
Since then, the Kurds have suffered under the despotic rule of rival ethnic groups.
There are obvious obstacles to holding such a referendum, primarily because the US does not have a mandate to dispose of Iraq as it pleases.
But the same goes for the rest of Iraq: the US is now lamely asking for a UN resolution mandating a transfer of power to a legitimate Iraqi government - but such an authorization is highly unlikely, nor is there anyone in Iraq to whom authority can conceivably be transferred.
Why should the one region - and people - who run an orderly government, are not involved in murder, attacks on mosques, and suicide bombing of schoolchildren, be penalized?
