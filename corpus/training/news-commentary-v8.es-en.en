SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Lately, with gold prices up more than 300% over the last decade, it is harder than ever.
Just last December, fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment, sensibly pointing out gold’s risks.
Wouldn’t you know it?
Since their articles appeared, the price of gold has moved up still further.
Gold prices even hit a record-high $1,300 recently.
Last December, many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $2,000.
Now, emboldened by continuing appreciation, some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that.
One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980’s.
Since then, the index has climbed above 10,000.
Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can’t it increase ten-fold, too?
Admittedly, getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems.
After adjusting for inflation, today’s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980.
Back then, gold hit $850, or well over $2,000 in today’s dollars.
But January 1980 was arguably a “freak peak” during a period of heightened geo-political instability.
At $1,300, today’s price is probably more than double very long-term, inflation-adjusted, average gold prices.
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here?
One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar.
With soaring deficits, and a rudderless fiscal policy, one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press.
And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge.
Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold.
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.
In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt, precisely so that its value might be inflated away.
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it can happen anywhere.
Even so, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable, so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations.
Some have argued instead that gold’s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold.
There is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument.
After all, medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold.
Wouldn’t it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more?
In my view, the most powerful argument to justify today’s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy.
As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities.
At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks.
With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar, gold’s appeal has naturally grown.
So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today’s higher gold price, although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future.
Indeed, another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization.
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements.
After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store.
Today, with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds.
But if real interest rates rise significantly, as well they might someday, gold prices could plummet.
Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term, with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance.
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.
Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago.
If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events.
But, despite gold’s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price, it remains a very risky bet for most of us.
Of course, such considerations might have little influence on prices.
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.
Last week Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin.
They departed pledging to revive Europe's growth.
We've heard that empty promise before.
Instead, the European Union needs a new direction.
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain's engagement with Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960's.
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986.
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union. But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states.
Faced with a new EU initiative, our traditional response has often been to oppose it, vote against it, lose the vote, then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else.
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes. So am I.
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept.
Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market; free movement of goods, services, people and capital.
But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy, far less a common taxation policy.
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness.
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours.
Which areas should be applied to every member state, and which should be optional?
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states.
In areas which serve their national interest, individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co‑operate with others.
The Union's members should form a series of overlapping circles: different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing.
Precedents exist for this.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO's central command.
Similar flexibility exists with the Euro, the Schengen Agreement, and the Social Chapter.
These precedents can be extended.
So far, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating specific opt‑outs. But since 1998, there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co‑operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member.
Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt‑out of a new initiative, those that support it can simply opt‑in.
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them.
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe.
That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey.
I don't want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to. But I don't want to block their way.
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely. But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken.
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out.
Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro, or hope for its failure.
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively.
It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework.
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution.
We disagree with many of its contents, of course, but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all.
There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty, and a single entity, whether you call it a state or not, with its own legal personality, deriving its authority from its own constitution.
If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form, the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system.
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra‑national constitution.
That is a radical change, not the mere tidying‑up exercise some suggest.
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties.
They safeguard them, and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate.
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state.
BRUSSELS – Austerity alone cannot solve Europe's economic and financial crisis.
Growth and jobs need to be promoted with equal zeal.
European Union leaders now recognize this: kick-starting growth in 2012 was high on the agenda at the European Council’s meeting on January 30.
But the big question remains: How?
The need for immediate action is clear.
The eurozone’s economy contracted in the last three months of 2011; even Germany’s shrank.
The new year is looking grim.
France is flat-lining (as is Britain).
Italy and Spain have sunk into deep recession.
Greece is in its fifth year of a slump.
And eurozone unemployment is at record highs, with nearly one in two young people jobless in Spain and Greece.
The economic headwinds are formidable: fiscal austerity, high interest rates outside AAA-rated countries, credit cutting by banks, deleveraging households, weak private-sector investment, and declining exports as the global slowdown undermines demand.
Until growth resumes, any tentative financial stabilization will be extremely fragile.
Recession will hit banks’ and governments’ already-weak balance sheets, increasing pressure for faster deleveraging.
But, while gradual adjustment is essential, faster and deeper cuts are largely self-defeating: big reductions in private credit and government spending will cause a sharper slowdown – and thus a vicious downward spiral.
A big new push for growth is therefore vital.
So far, the growth agenda has consisted largely of structural reforms, which are essential for boosting future productivity and flexibility.
The crisis does provide a political opportunity for bold moves on this front in many countries; but structural reforms generally will not generate growth and jobs immediately (one exception is permitting shops to open longer).
On the contrary, a shakeout of less productive jobs, for example, would at first raise unemployment, increase government outlays, and reduce private spending.
And, because demand is depressed, credit is in short supply, and barriers to enterprise are often high, it will take longer than usual for businesses to create more productive jobs.
In short, structural reforms alone cannot be relied upon to stimulate growth in 2012.
Instead, the immediate focus needs to be on boosting investment and exports in economies with a current-account deficit – such as France, Italy, and Spain (and the United Kingdom) – and stimulating consumption in surplus countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.
The European Central Bank has acted decisively to prop up European banks; now it needs to support the real economy, too.
While official interest rates are only 1%, solvent sovereigns such as Spain pay more than 5% to borrow for ten years, while creditworthy businesses in Italy can borrow only at punitive rates, if at all.
So the ECB should do more to unblock the transmission mechanism for monetary policy; the European Banking Authority should discourage excessive deleveraging by insisting that banks raise specific capital amounts rather than hit a uniform 9% ratio; and, where necessary, national governments should provide guarantees for bank lending to small and medium-size businesses.
While improving access to finance is vital, governments also need to do more to boost investment.
They should prioritize measures to make it easier to start a business, lift barriers to venture capital, and introduce temporary 100% capital allowances to encourage businesses to bring forward investment.
At the EU level, the (callable) capital of the European Investment Bank should be greatly increased, as European Commission President José Manuel Barroso suggested in his State of the Union speech last September, so that the EIB can finance a big wave of pan-European investment, notably in infrastructure.
Boosting exports is also essential.
Deficit countries need to become more competitive, increasing productivity while cutting costs.
A more competitive currency would be welcome: just as the sterling’s collapse since 2008 has lifted UK exports, a weaker euro would help Mediterranean economies regain competitiveness for price-sensitive exports.
A fiscal devaluation – slashing payroll taxes and replacing the revenues with a higher VAT – would also help.
Surplus countries, too, must do their part, which is in their own interest.
Just as China needs to allow the renminbi to rise, so Germany – whose current-account surplus exceeds China's both as a share of GDP and in absolute terms – needs a higher real exchange rate.
That means that Germans need to earn higher wages, commensurate with their increased productivity, so that they can afford more Greek and Spanish holidays.
If businesses will not oblige, an income-tax cut would do the trick.
That brings us to fiscal policy.
Governments that cannot borrow cheaply (or at all) from markets have no option but to tighten their belts.
But they should pursue smart consolidation rather than unthinking austerity.
So they should maintain investment in skills and infrastructure, while cutting subsidies and transfer payments.
They should also legislate now for future reforms, notably to encourage people to work longer.
Last but not least, governments that can borrow at unprecedentedly low rates – 0% in real terms over 10 years in the case of Germany – must play their role in supporting demand.
Would it be really be so difficult to see VAT coming down ahead of the German election next year?
At the onset of the US-led war in Iraq, two competing views shaped predictions about the outcome.
The first contended that overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime would usher in a democratic era in Iraq that would serve as a model and catalyst for democratic change regionally.
Derided by detractors as a new "domino theory," this view presented intervention in Iraq as similar to America's role in post-WWII Japan.
Against the optimism of that "Japan scenario," pessimists argued that a "Somalia scenario" was more likely.
They staked their claim on the tribal, sectarian, and multiethnic nature of Iraq, which, in the absence of dictatorship, would supposedly incite Iraq's collapse into a "failed state," with rampant warlordism, ethnic and religious feuds, and harboring of terrorist organizations.
But the main question now is whether Iraq will drift along lines somewhere between these two scenarios, increasingly resembling Afghanistan.
This "Afghan scenario" implies a weak state with nominal power over effectively autonomous fiefdoms that are headed by strongmen who are represented in the central government.
Bad as it sounds, this prospect appears to be a "realistic" compromise between the supposedly utopian vision of a flourishing, unified democracy and the wretchedness of a failed state.
Many of the actions and policies of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), as well as higher-level Bush administration decisions, seem to point to a resigned acceptance that early hopes that Iraq would embrace Western-style democracy were misplaced.
Indeed, such hopes were misplaced.
Iraq's political culture - and that of most of the Middle East - is incompatible with the basic components of a recognizable Western-style democracy: notions of individual rights and responsibilities are lacking, the concept of a patriarchal state is deeply rooted, and individual cultural identity is rarely tied to the national community.
On the other hand, much circular logic figures in analyses that consider the "traditional" nature of Iraqi society an obstacle to liberal democracy. For these analyses are hardly neutral, but unwittingly enter an ongoing confrontation.
In Iraq, as elsewhere in the Arab and Muslim worlds, a cultural war is being waged between two paradigms: grand narratives that accept and promote a collectivistic understanding (nationalism, socialism, Islamism), versus an implicit paradigm of individualistic modernity that is locally rooted yet informed by the global experience.
The frontlines of this war are notions of the individual, cultural identity, civil society, and the nation-state.
The religious Islamic component in Iraqi social life should not be underestimated.
But it also should not be equated with the political Islamism that strives to capitalize on it.
Nationalist and leftist political discourses did leave an imprint on the Iraqi value system, but they are not its sole components.
Indeed, the nominal acceptance of grand narratives of "democracy" and "human rights" as common bases for political discourse represents a crucial shift in demarcating the cultural battle.
This cultural debate is not limited to the Arab scene.
There are also vigorous discussions in the West about the applicability of democratic institutions to the Arab context.
Advocates of the notion of "Arab exceptionalism," which questions the ability of Arab societies to adapt democratic systems are in fact objectively allied with "grand narrative" ideologues - and also with the beneficiaries of the Arab world's patronage-based political order.
The models used in the West, both in political circles and in academia, for the analysis and interpretation of Arab societies are seriously deficient.
In particular, many analyses nowadays promote an ethnic model, reducing Iraq to an artificial construct that rests atop a fragmented "reality" of separate communities.
Some have even suggested hastening the outcome predicted by this faulty view by dividing Iraq into its "genuine" original components: Sunni, Shi`i, and Kurd.
In fact, Iraqi society is more complex than this.
The reception and adoption of democracy is not a function of sectarian belonging, but a reflection of the multi-dimensional historical, cultural, religious, and political identities of Iraqi individuals.
Given the right circumstances, it is eminently possible to mobilize Iraqi society towards a democratic formulation of its state-to-be.
The fall of Saddam ushers in the right circumstances.
Indeed, the seeming failure of a recognizable democratic core to emerge in Iraq within the first few months of the collapse of Saddam's dictatorship is due more to idiosyncrasies of the process than to any presumed essential nature of Iraqi society.
Upon Saddam's fall, a large "middle ground" existed in Iraq that was positively disposed towards democratic discourse and practice.
Policy mistakes and reversals eroded this middle ground, opening a path for ideological Islamism and a reconstituted neo-Ba`athism.
The key mistake was the failure of occupation forces to equip and empower the small group of Iraqi liberal democratic figures to tap into this middle ground.
As a result, the space for a liberal democratic outcome receded.
But to treat this setback as a failure would be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Iraqi democrats must re-assess and develop a clear public strategy.
The CPA, and the world community, must not prejudice the outcome of their efforts by accepting a facile and bogus view of Iraqi society.
Even if such efforts succeed, the road to a full-fledged democratic system in Iraq will still be arduous and expensive.
But instead of succumbing to a "Somalia scenario," dreaming of a "Japan scenario," or settling for an "Afghanistan scenario," Iraq may yet become a "scenario" for successful intervention in the 21 st century.
ANKARA – Nowadays, the international media are obsessed with the question of who “lost” Turkey and what that supposed loss means for Europe and the West.
More alarmingly, some commentators liken Turkey’s neighborhood policy to a revival of Ottoman imperialism.
Recently, a senior Turkish columnist went so far as to quote Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu as saying that “we are indeed neo-Ottoman.”
As someone who was present when Davutoğlu made his presentation to the parliamentary faction of Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), I can attest to the fact that he did not use such terminology.
In fact, Davutoğlu and all of us in the AKP foreign-policy community never use this term, because it is simply a mispresentation of our position.
Turkey’s neighborhood policy is devised to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhoods, including the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, the Middle East, and the Eastern Mediterranean.
We aim to deepen our political dialogue, increase our trade, and multiply our people-to-people contacts with our neighbors in the form of sports, tourism, and cultural actvities.
When Egon Bahr formulated his Ostpolitik in the 1960’s, no one asked Will Brandt whether Germany was lost.
God bestowed upon Turkey a geographical position that fundamentally requires for us to engage with East and West, North and South.
This is neither a choice nor a luxury – it is a necessity.
The symbol of the Byzantine and the Selçuk Empires, which occupied roughly the same geography that Turkey does today, was a double-headed eagle looking both east and west.
It should be no wonder that Turkey is also seeking to engage both ends of its territories and feels that its security is best consolidated by minimizing risks together with its neighbors.
So we find the current debate on Turkey’s orientation rather superflous, and in some cases ill-intentioned.
Our neighborhood policy needs support, not criticism.
Turkey has become an invaluable asset in the make-up of our surrounding regions, and is already changing the status quo in favor of more stability and predictability.
Our efforts at normalization with Armenia, for example, are destined to bring change to the entire South Caucasus.
We are doing our part in terms of burden-sharing.
Sensible Europeans understand that.
To be sure, some of our neighbors are difficult. But no country has the luxury of choosing its neighbors.
Turkey’s neighborhood policy is very realistic, based on genuine interests, not some romantic neo-Ottoman nostagia, as more than a few international commentators have suggested.
True, there is a neo-Ottoman revival in the cultural field, and our citizens are eager to rediscover Ottoman life, culture, and practices.
As Turkey is normalizing domestically, it is also reinterpreting its national historical narrative.
This is a natural byproduct of consolidating our democracy.
However, trying to paint our carefully constructed foreign-policy initiatives with imperialist overtones is not only a stark mispresentation, but also does gross injustice to our well-intentioned efforts to stabilize our region.
In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of gates, doorways, beginnings, and endings.
Turkey today is a Janus-like geography that offers gates and doorways to the East and West.
It offers beginnings and endings to the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean.
In this capacity, Turkey complements and contributes to a unique transitional passage between otherwise difficult regions, for it signifies centuries-old co-existence and adjustment.
Turkish foreign policy contributes to that coming together and helps its immeditate neighborhoods to connect with one another.
Contrary to recent charges, Turkey’s foreign policymakers are not seeking to revive the Ottoman Empire.
Instead, we seek Turkey’s historic reintegration into its immediate neighborhoods, thereby correcting an anomaly of the Cold War years.
Such re-integration would only benefit the European Union and our other Western, NATO allies.
None of them, therefore, has any reason to express discomfort with Turkey.
Although the EU's eastward enlargement has not yet happened, the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow: when should the new, predominantly postcommunist, members adopt the euro?
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty's provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry. 
At the outset, it must be stressed that, in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed.
Early entry, otherwise, would be an empty gesture. 
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible, but preferable to delay.
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II).
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004, new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006. 
Is this realistic?
Well, most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU.
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991, when the collapse of the Soviet-era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets.
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece, Portugal, and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU. 
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive.
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4-5% - not much higher than in many EU countries, and lower than in The Netherlands last year.
As with structural convergence, EU candidates already outperform Spain, Portugal, and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut.
Nor is there much risk of large, future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized. 
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows.
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the so-called "Balassa-Samuelson" effect: rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates' tradable sectors - export manufacturing, for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies, including in non-tradable sectors like services.
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average. 
The Balassa-Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece, Spain and Portugal.
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates, its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1-2%.
With the Balassa-Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation, the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5% of the average rate for the three best-performing economies in the EU - is within reach. 
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership?
From the standpoint of current member states, would admitting Hungary, Latvia, Poland, or Slovakia, sooner rather than later, drag down the euro as many fear? 
Fears that extending EMU to new states "too soon" would undermine the euro's external exchange rate are irrational.
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time, they will together account for a mere 6% of its total GDP. So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error. 
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information.
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise.
Equally, the transition period is already turbulent, with convergence-driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.
Indeed, capital-flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15% fluctuation band either side of a central parity. 
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer-term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves.
The benefit is simple: ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility, as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro.
This would help keep the candidates' economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels. 
This is an exceptionally weak argument, and a politically suspect one, too.
As European Central Bank data shows, average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44% of the eurozone level.
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry, probably lasting several decades.
More important, long-lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed (EMU) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms. 
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms.
In almost all candidates, further disinflation and long-term economic growth require fiscal consolidation, more flexible labor markets, and completion of privatization.
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms. 
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear.
Early adoption, by contrast, would be more conducive to these reforms, and thus to real convergence.
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency, reduced transaction costs, and a solid macroeconomic framework.
This strategy, not one of deferred entry, promises the most for both the EU's current and its future members. 
PARIS – As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening.
At the start of the crisis, many people likened it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns.
Today, the mood is much grimmer, with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional.
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).
Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms.
For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989.
Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Indeed, on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism.
Yet 2008-2009, like 1989, may very well correspond to an epochal change, whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades.
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.
And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies.
In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc.
For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets.
Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now.
First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity.
By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union.
Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish winners from losers.
Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others.
Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass. In better shape, but not alone.
As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes.
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.
From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard, Asians – Chinese and Indians, in particular – are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much, and whom they would overcome in the coming decades.
But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos.
What, for example, will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?
When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer.
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “European dream” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe’s supposedly open countries?
The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers, including me, would have assumed.
We can only hope that, in the end, the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be.
MOSCOW – Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert, someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups.
In fact, my formal residence is in New York City, but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia, training to be a cosmonaut in Star City, just outside Moscow. 
It all came about in a number of ways.
First of all, as a kid, I just assumed that I would go to the moon, without having to do much in particular to make it happen.
I just took it for granted that, by the time I was, say, 40, space travel would be a common thing.
My father was involved with the United States space program, and we had some moon rocks at home, so I thought it was no big deal.
Then I got distracted for about 40 years.
A few years ago, however, I started paying attention to space again.
A lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same: Elon Musk, a co-founder of PayPal, founded Space-X; Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin; Jeff Greason, a senior manager at Intel, started XCOR Aerospace (in which I’m an investor).
In 2005, the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs, I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation.
Meanwhile, in about 2005, I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy.
One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (sold to VeriSign), who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “space tourist.”
One evening, the group sat around a campfire as the sun set, and around 50 African schoolchildren were bussed in.
Altogether, there were about 100 of us, President Mbeki included, around a roaring fire.
Once it was dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space.
He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures, complete with clips of him floating around, catching bubbles in his mouth, and so on.
The kids loved it, and I'm sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science.
Eventually, I invested in Space Adventures, the company that organized Shuttleworth’s trip into space.
Later, I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi, the fifth (and soon seventh) space tourist, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. (Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program, and now has another start-up, Intentional Software, and a foundation, as well as a Web site, CharlesinSpace.org.)
Soon after, I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team.
Yes, I would love to actually go, but the trip to space costs $35 to $40 million, whereas backup training costs “only” $3 million.
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is (very) tentatively slated to go.
Space Adventures was pushing for 2009, but I was pretty busy.
Then something happened last spring: my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy.
(She is doing well now and, in fact, just won a mini-marathon.) A couple of weeks later, I was faced with one of those conflicts: a board meeting here, a conference there, another opportunity at the same time somewhere else.
“Aaagh,” I thought, “if only I had a double mastectomy: I could cancel all these things and no one would complain!”

Good grief!  I realized my priorities were all out of whack.   So in some odd way, this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy – a positive one, to be sure, but the same kind of reset-button experience. 
It is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through 23andMe (www.23andme.com) and the Personal Genome Project (www.personalgenome.org): If you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer’s in a few years, what would you do?
Why, I’d go train to be a cosmonaut, of course! And why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer’s?  Next month, I will write about what training to go into space actually involves.
Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date.
It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, a new era perhaps, but in any case a time of change.
The terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered; but it is “9/11” that has become the catchphrase, almost like “August 1914.”
But was it really a war that started on September 11, 2001?
Not all are happy about this American notion.
During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged.
“War” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement.
This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal.
By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country.
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”
Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations, the Patriot Act’s overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty, such as habeas corpus , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom.
From an early date, the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of: the arrest without trial of “illegal combatants” who are deprived of all human rights.
The world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places.
For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights.
Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few.
A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims.
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.
On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble.
In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory.
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.
In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define.
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.
The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific.
In most countries of continental Europe, “9/11” has remained an American date.
There is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “war against terrorism” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.
This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst .
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.
People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling.
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.
Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems.
While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst.
One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators’ resentment of the West and its ways.
But the West’s key features, democracy and the rule of law, have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers.
Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11.
First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary.
Some of today’s restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly.
Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety.
The terrorists with whom we are currently at “war” cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy.
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.
NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission. In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them.
September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point.
It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace.
On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated.
Despite the attention devoted to the “Global War on Terrorism,” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies, globalization, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political upheavals in the Middle East. 
As for the future, it is much more likely to be defined by the United States’ need to put its economic house in order; China’s trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world’s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges.
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.
They can destroy but not create.
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.
Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists.
Intelligence assets have been redirected.
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.
International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area.
Military force has played a role as well.
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.
Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders.
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.
But progress is not to be confused with victory.
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.
There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals.
Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas.
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.
A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago.
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.
The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world.
The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: “Are we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?”
All things being equal, we probably are.
But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so.
What is to be done?
Alas, there is no single or silver bullet.
The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India.
Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty.
Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done.
Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so.
But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism.
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this.
Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police.
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.
The world has tried with little success to cut carbon emissions under the Kyoto Protocol.
The enormous effort expended to bring the Protocol into force nonetheless indicates how much work will be required to produce the next treaty, due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December 2009.
Campaigners will push for tough and far-reaching policies, but strong resistance will continue from countries concerned about their economic vitality.
The new negotiations will have one advantage over the earlier efforts, because governments now understand the need for a portfolio of adaptation, mitigation, and research efforts.
New research that my colleagues and I undertook for the Copenhagen Consensus Center in Denmark explores the effectiveness of different responses to this global challenge, but it strongly supports the portfolio approach for several reasons.
First, we now know that adaptation will be essential, because temperatures will rise by another 0.6°C by 2100 even if greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated tomorrow.
We also know that the impact of climate change will not be evenly distributed across the globe.
In some areas, modestly warmer temperatures could produce higher crop yields if associated changes in precipitation patterns are not adverse and/or irrigation remains viable.
Even with 0.6°C warming, however, Africa and South Asia will experience almost immediate reductions in the viability of many crops and, eventually, increased vulnerability to infectious disease.
These impacts will clearly hit the planet’s worst-off inhabitants hardest: the “bottom billion” who already bear the heaviest burden of disease, poverty, conflict and malnutrition.&#160;
Ensuring that adaptive capacity is expanded and exploited where it is most needed is thus a key challenge.
Long-term development may give countries more capacity to soften the impact of climate change on the environment and citizens’ health, but in the meantime the planet’s poorest people will need help from the rich.
Our analysis investigated, for example, the merits of more targeted policies for the near term: purchasing mosquito-resistant bed nets and oral re-hydration malaria therapy for children in the poorest nations affected by climate change.
The goal was to deal aggressively and proactively with some of the marginal health impacts of global warming.
Benefits would appear almost immediately, but would dissipate over time as economies developed.
Even as development improves conditions, however, reducing carbon emissions would become increasingly important over the longer term as the impact of climate change become more severe.
Since the effects of climate change have been observed in many areas around the world, thinking about mitigation makes sense everywhere.
But we found that mitigationalone did not meet a standard cost-benefit test.
We allowed specified annual costs of climate policy to grow in proportion with global GDP through 2100 from an initial annual benchmark of $18 billion.
The discounted cost of the resulting stream of fixed annual costs totaled $800 billion, but damages avoided by this approach amounted to a discounted value of only $685 billion.
The Copenhagen Consensus study also examined a portfolio option of the sort heralded by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
We allocated $50 billion to research into greener technology, so that only $750 billion could be absorbed by the economic cost of adaptation and mitigation.
The gap between the cost of carbon-free and carbon-emitting technology fell, and the taxes designed to mitigate emissions became more effective.
As a result, the research and development program essentially paid for itself, and total discounted benefits for the $800 billion investment climbed to more than $2.1 trillion.&#160;
Ensuring that research and development is part of the world’s climate change response portfolio would make mitigation efforts more efficient and significantly enhance their ability to reduce carbon emissions over the next century.
But these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “come onboard.”
Optimizing investment in the portfolio over time would, for example, increase the discounted benefits by more than a factor of three.
Expected benefits would increase further if we included the chance that potentially higher climate sensitivities would exacerbate damages, even though doing so would require including similarly plausible lower climate sensitivities, which would push in the opposite direction.
Fighting climate change can be a sound investment, even though neither mitigation nor adaptation alone will be enough to “solve” the problem.
To make a real difference, especially in the near term, the world must combine mitigation and adaptation with increased research and development into carbon-saving and sequestering technology, which in turn requires designing and exploiting market-based incentives.
STOCKHOLM – One year after the war in Georgia of last August, pushing the “reset” button on diplomatic relations is a popular endeavor nowadays.
President Barack Obama recently journeyed to Moscow in order to “reset” strained United States-Russian ties.
The European Union, though not in need of a “reset” because of strained ties with its eastern neighbors, is involved in a deep strategic reconstruction of those relations.
When the EU launched its new “Eastern Partnership” in May, the purpose was to promote further integration with the Union’s six immediate eastern neighbors – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.
The global financial crisis had made an updated and strengthened policy for the EU’s eastern neighborhood an urgent need.
Equally important was the fact that all the countries concerned expressed an ambition to move closer to the EU.
The Eastern Partnership – originating from a Polish/Swedish initiative – offers to the six countries a substantial upgrading and deepening of relations with the EU in key areas.
In trade and economic relations, it clearly sets out the objective of establishing deep and comprehensive free-trade areas between the EU and the partner countries.
It confirms full visa liberalization as a long-term goal (with visa facilitation agreements in the meantime), promises enhanced cooperation on energy security, diversification, and efficiency, and comes with dedicated programs and projects to help the neighbors in their integration and reform efforts in all these areas.
Sweden’s assumption of the EU Presidency this month should help these efforts.
However, it comes at a time when the Union’s eastern neighborhood faces severe challenges, with the financial and economic crisis hitting many of the partner countries hard.
Ukraine suffers from the sharp drop in global demand and trade, severely undermining its steel industry.
Georgia’s economic success has been largely dependent on direct foreign investment, for which there is hardly any appetite today.
Partner countries that are less integrated into the global market, such as Moldova, have seen the crisis arrive more slowly, but the real effect might be equally as bad, and they are likely to recover more slowly.
The Eastern Partnership does not offer any quick remedies to the crisis. But it can provide a political framework and institution-building support to improve the deficiencies that made these countries so vulnerable to the crisis: imperfect market economies, weak state institutions, and continued corruption.
The Eastern Partnership’s offer of deep integration with the EU in the areas such as trade and energy carries with it considerable transformational power.
The other type of crisis that most of the partner countries are enduring is political.
In most of these countries, democratic development has not yet reached a point where a change in government is a routine part of political life and can take place without risking the country’s stability.
The Eastern Partnership is based on the profound values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.
Political association with the EU, and the process of integration under this Partnership, will promote reforms in these key areas.
The Swedish EU Presidency will concentrate on starting up the concrete work – the nuts and bolts – of the Partnership.
The establishment of “Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs,” designed to support reform of key institutions in each partner country, should take place before the year’s end.
Some flagship initiatives proposed by the European Commission will finally see the light of day as well, and new projects and initiatives are likely to be developed.
Here, Sweden will attach particular importance to energy efficiency programs, which will serve not only the purposes of enhancing energy security and reducing costs, but will also be an important contribution to the fight against climate change.
The Swedish Presidency, together with the European Commission, intends to organize the first meeting of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum this autumn.
We hope to see the start of parliamentary cooperation, as well as exchanges between local and regional authorities of the thirty-three EU and partner countries.
At the end of the year, a meeting of EU foreign ministers and their colleagues from the six partners will assess the progress made so far and give guidance on the way ahead.
The Eastern Partnership is about EU integration, about the six countries moving closer to the EU’s values, legislation, and ways of working, and about the EU being there to support and help this convergence.
In Russia, there is a perception that is sometimes fostered which suggests that the Partnership is directed against it. But this, of course, is untrue.
On the contrary, Russia, like Turkey, will be welcome to take part in relevant activities within the Partnership’s multilateral dimensions.
The Eastern Partnership is not an answer to all the problems and difficulties that the six partners are facing.
Nevertheless, it does represent a clear commitment by the EU to lend its political and economic support to their transition and reform – a process that should bring prosperity and stability to the whole region.
PARIS – “Let’s engage Russia if we can, but contain it if we must.”
These two alternatives already defined Western strategy toward Russia in the mid-1990’s.
Since then, Russia may have changed dramatically, but not our questions about it.
What do you do when your big neighbor widens the gap that exists between its culture, which is European, and its political system, which is becoming increasingly “Asian,” at least in the bad old sense of “Oriental despotism”?
Should the best answer to the return of Russia’s imperial ambitions be a modern version of a Holy Alliance of stability designed to contain the world’s new maverick?
Or is a latter-day Yalta Conference, aimed at redrawing the political boundaries of Europe, necessary?
Could the answer be a bit of both?
If Russia is becoming what revolutionary France was under Napoleon, or reverting to Soviet form – shorn of a totalitarian ideology but with an appetite for conquest and re-conquest – what is needed is not the “league of democracies” advocated by some conservatives in America.
What is needed, instead, is a “stability league” that includes prominent actors like China, India, and other countries that are more interested in economic growth than in “rocking the boat” of the international system.
Such a strategy implies, first of all, a solid partnership with China, not because it is evolving in the direction of democracy, but because it is a status-quo power.
Such a strategy could lead to the opening of negotiations with Iran, and of course to a further closing of ranks within NATO.
The message to the Kremlin here would be crystal clear.
“Do not fool yourself.
Nationalism and imperialism will lead you nowhere; you cannot expand geographically without serious costs to your economic growth and your personal enrichment.
Europe may be weak and divided, America may no longer be what it was, but with your falling population and the sad state of your economy beyond oil and gas, you simply are not equipped to be in the league of great global powers.
China is; you are not.”
But the containment argument fails, because the Kremlin can still make mischief around the world by acting with Syria or Venezuela in an irresponsible manner.
More importantly, rallying the world solely against Russia would mean taking Russia’s great power pretensions too seriously.
For example, many Asians believe that Russia is a problem for Europe, but no longer for the world.
At the Cold War’s end, Japan remained obsessed with Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union.
Today, the Japanese are so concerned with China that they have little time for fears about Russia.
The other alternative to a rebirth of “containment” would consist in accepting the Russian argument, or more precisely, Russian “emotions.”
It would mean saying, in effect, “We have unnecessarily humiliated you over the last ten years.
From NATO enlargement to the grant of independence to Kosovo, we have deliberately ignored your sensitivities and your interests.
Let’s sit down together like Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at Yalta and redesign a twenty-first-century map of Europe.
What do you want back?
What do we keep?”
This approach might recognize Russia’s droit de regard on the future evolution of the Caucasus.
Indeed, while talking tough under the guidance of Nicolas Sarkozy’s France, which currently holds the EU presidency, Europe has de facto resigned itself to Georgia’s dismemberment.
Russian troops are to remain in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
The West is not about to declare war on Russia for the sake of a Georgia whose credibility has been greatly eroded by its president’s irresponsible behavior.
As for Ukraine, it may one day become part of the European Union, but its future is not in NATO.
Yet, between all-out containment, which is very unlikely and not necessarily desirable or realistic, and accommodation which borders on appeasement, which would be dangerous for Europe’s future, a third way, based on a few firm principles, must be found.
These principles are clear.
First, Ukraine’s territorial integrity is not negotiable.
This has been said many times, but repetition does not diminish its importance.
Russia without Ukraine is a manageable nation-state; Russia with Ukraine is an unmanageable empire.
Second, even if the West condemns Georgia’s irresponsibility and incorporates into its policy Russia’s sensitivities on the complex historical feelings related to its ex-imperial territories, the Kremlin’s shameless brutality is unacceptable.
After all, this is Europe more than six decades after World War II, and nearly 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The use of force to settle scores and impose one nation’s will upon another cannot be accepted passively.
In the short term, time may be on Russia’s side.
In the long run – economically, demographically, politically, strategically – time is on “our” side, if we stick to our values and our principles.
The drubbing that many governments suffered in the recent elections to the European Union Parliament places them in a difficult position as they maneuver ahead of this week's EU Summit.
Only an incurable optimist can hope that the summit will bring glory to any of them.
The summit has two purposes: to finalize the text of a new EU Constitution, and to appoint the next President of the Commission.
These negotiations will be much harder in view of the spectacular repudiation of a number of key governments at the ballot box, together with the potent rise of protest and Euroskeptic parties in several member states.
The problem for Europe's leaders is that their own repudiation by voters does not necessarily carry the same message as the rise of the Euroskeptic parties.
The record slump in the vote for Gerhard Schröder's governing Social Democrats in Germany has little to do with his policy towards Europe, but a great deal to do with the perceived failure of his economic policies - and the persistence of low growth and high unemployment - at home.
Despite nationalist parties' success in France, the same is true of the setback for President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party.
In Britain, by contrast, where the economy is strong and unemployment low, the main factor behind the collapse in the vote for the governing Labor Party has been anger with Tony Blair's determination to go to war in Iraq beside George Bush.
Nevertheless, the rise of Euroskeptic parties, in a number of countries including Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, and the Czech Republic, has worrying implications for a summit meeting whose purpose is to take European integration a small but unmistakable step forward.
In Britain, in particular, the spectacular surge of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) can only strengthen the government's long-standing latent Euroskepticism.
The proposed constitution will contain a Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is intended to enhance the political and moral legitimacy of the EU.
But will it really enhance the rights of EU citizens?
Or, as the British government insists, will it merely be a declaratory document that only describes rights already existing under national legislation in the member states.
The draft constitution would enhance the policymaking powers of the Union, with a bit more majority voting in the Council of Ministers, and a stronger role for the European Parliament.
But, despite Tony Blair's one-time declaration that he would take Britain "into the heart of Europe," he remains viscerally opposed to the prospect of further integration, and he will resist any new encroachment on British sovereignty in his "red line" areas of tax, foreign policy, and EU budget finance.
Blair's Euroskepticism is understandable insofar as it chimes with the British mood.
Opinion polls consistently show that British voters are unenthusiastic about the EU, and the picture is confirmed by the latest Eurobarometer poll, conducted throughout the Union for the Commission - but before the recent enlargement from 15 to 25 member states.
One question always asked in this poll is whether voters tend to trust or mistrust different institutions, such as national parliaments, national governments, and the European Union.
Overall, the general level of trust in the European Union is not high: only 41% of voters tend to trust the EU, whereas 42% tend not to trust it.
But in Britain, the figures are dramatically different: only 19% trust the EU, while 55% distrust it.
By contrast, the European Parliament has a better reputation than the EU as a whole: the average EU-wide level of trust in the European Parliament is 54%, whereas in Britain it is 30%.
Across the EU, 48% think EU membership is a good thing; in Britain, this figure falls to 29%.
On virtually every question, British voters are less enthusiastic about the EU than voters in any other country. 
One might think that Britons' aversion to the EU would be reflected in support for, and pride in, their national institutions. Not so.
British trust in the European Parliament may stand at only 30%; but trust in the Westminster Parliament is much lower, at only 19% - the lowest figure in the EU.
Trust in the national government is a bit higher, but still only 25%, while trust in national political parties is only 10%.
Both figures are, again, the lowest in the EU.
Voters in other states have more confidence in EU institutions, but their opinion of their own institutions is also low.
In France, 57% trust the European Parliament, but only 29% trust the French parliament; while the corresponding figures for Germany are 51% and 23%. 
But the puzzle in the poll is that, even if Europe's voters are unenthusiastic about the EU and its existing institutions as they stand now, 65% of them would support a common foreign policy for Europe, and 72% would support a common defense and security policy; even in Britain, there is 52% support for the idea of a common defense policy.
This may be a reaction to the American-led war in Iraq; but Tony Blair will exclude it precisely for that reason, and a common European defense policy without Britain makes little sense.
The predicament for Europe's leaders at this week's summit is that they stand at the cusp of an unstable process of European integration.
With the accession of 10 new members, the EU must become more integrated if it is to function.
But it is not at all clear that those governments that would normally support more integration can sell it to their disillusioned electorates.
Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the new EU constitution, which he cannot possibly win.
The central question will be whether Europe's "leaders" deliberately play for failure, in the hope that the problem will go away.
WASHINGTON, DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America’s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending, thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States.
But the agreement has three major flaws.
Two of them offset each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years: economic growth.
The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed: coming as they do when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession.
The measure’s second shortcoming, however, is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest.
While the legislation does too little to address America’s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited.
The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places.
Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving, intact, America’s principal welfare programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, the legislation does not touch either of them.
These programs’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead.
And, because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes, any time, under any circumstances, the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides.
All of the spending cuts come from the “discretionary” part of the federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor, and interest on the national debt.
That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut, and much of that goes to the defense budget, which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future.
So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget, which is only about 10% of it.
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead.
Worse yet, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America’s future prosperity and global standing.
Growth is, in the first place, the best way to reduce the country’s budget deficits.
The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits.
Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one, the popular term for which is “the American dream.”
Just as important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.
As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a crucial factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership, which dates back to the founding of the country, that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation.
That partnership has five components: wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills; investment in infrastructure – roads, power plants, and ports – that supports commerce; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America’s borders; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth.
The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money, and that money is included in the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation.
Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term, with negative consequences both at home and abroad.
Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers. Most of the weight will remain, and one’s life prospects will have worsened significantly.
Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way.
Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US – and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world.
EU Commission President Romano Prodi has proposed a scheme to strengthen the Union's executive.
Britain, France, and Spain are working on an opposing plan that will consolidate EU executive powers among the biggest EU states.
What's the ordinary European to think?
Europe's citizens scarcely grasp the issues at the heart of the European Constitutional Convention in Brussels.
Mountains of detail obscure problems; sterile, misleading national discussions that pit "Euroskeptics" against "Europhiles" muster sound and fury but clarify nothing.
So complicated do many issues seem that some newspapers and broadcasters have abandoned reporting about the Convention.
EU citizens can secure a clearer understanding of what the Convention should achieve by asking this question: how should governmental functions be divided between the EU and its member nations?
To answer this, we need to grasp government's true purpose.
Government should provide citizens with public goods: collective defense, legislation and regulation, enforcement of the rule of law.
These can be provided at different levels: local, regional, national, or supranational government, i.e., the EU.
But what is the right level?
In some areas, decentralization works because it recognizes diverse local or national communities.
However, local decisions often have repercussions on citizens in other communities.
So certain services should be allocated to a broader geographic unit because they have externalities (that is, interdependence of effects).
Europe's allocation of governmental powers should be based on the principle that institutions carry out only those activities with clear economies of scale and where differences of opinion are modest.
The lower a government activity's externalities, the more it should be localized.
Low externalities imply limited benefits to be gained from centralization; deep differences among citizens imply that the costs of harmonization would be too high.
The euro, for example, delivers clear advantages of scale by favoring international commerce and avoiding negative externalities.
No longer can the lira be devalued to favor Italian exports to the detriment of the French, followed by a French reaction, etc.
Although the imperfectly synchronized economic cycles of EU members causes friction over monetary and exchange rate policy, the euro's benefits outweigh the costs of diversity.
In educational policy, however, to impose the same system on all members would not create economies of scale.
Cultural differences are too strong to win voluntary compliance.
It would be absurd to delegate education and culture to a supranational level.
Of the areas of public policy with high economies of scale or externalities, two stand out: the common market and competition; and foreign policy and defense.
The former covers antitrust, trade, and the common currency.
Some think that fiscal policies - from the structure of taxation to welfare, to budget balances - should also be harmonized.
But national preferences are diverse, and if mechanically imposed, fiscal centralization might incite resistance.
Nor do centralized fiscal policies have any real raison d'être from a constitutional point of view.
The US Constitution, for example, does not prescribe balanced budgets for the states.
Only in exceptional circumstances is fiscal harmonization justified: prohibitions, say, on fiscal incentives aimed at limiting competition, impeding commerce, or restricting the movement of capital.
Foreign policy and defense belong, par excellence, at government's apex.
There are clear externalities and economies of scale.
It would be absurd if New York pursued a different foreign policy than Texas.
Much the same is true in Europe.
The addition of new EU members implies that more internal differences will occur, which means that fewer centralized policies are justified.
These considerations suggest a series of principles for the Convention to consider:
1.
The EU Constitution should establish unequivocally which prerogatives belong to Europe and which to member countries.
When in doubt, the principle of subsidiarity suggests that national states remain supreme;
2.
European-level institutions should guarantee the functioning of markets, including competition, commercial, and monetary policies;
3.
Fiscal policy should remain largely decentralized, save for a few exceptions;
4.
Foreign policy and defense are areas of federal competence, to be delegated to Europe at a proper time;
5.
The creation of new areas of federal competence should be accompanied by decision-making mechanisms found in genuinely representative democracies.
So "No centralization without representation."
Today's EU diverges enormously from these principles (see table), as is demonstrated by the fact that agriculture, which represents 2% of European GDP, accounts for 40% of EU expenditures.

Europe faces an historic opportunity.
America's founding fathers wrote a Constitution that has lasted over 200 years.
Members of the European Convention obviously face a far more complex and diverse society-and thus a more daunting constitutional challenge.
But they can succeed by displaying comparable wisdom and foresight.
BEIJING – Before July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth.
It was argued that the United States’ rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio – the result of chronic current-account deficits – would put a sharp brake on capital inflows, in turn weakening the dollar, driving up interest rates, and plunging the US economy into crisis.
But this scenario failed to materialize.
Instead, the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle, which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930’s.
Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis, because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt.
Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt.
In particular, they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt.
In 2007, the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90%, compared to 24% for net foreign debt.
Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability.
But all parts of a country’s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected.
This means two things.
First, funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree: deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components.
Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components.
After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default.
The fall in US total debt, and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds, led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “saving glut.”
Indeed, America’s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar’s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand.
Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession.
To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.
Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again.
Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment.
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.
But where will increased competitiveness come from?
Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution.
Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities, devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America’s budget deficit.
If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession.
In the long run, America’s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation.
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight.
In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses.
Thus, China’s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability.
Given that America benefits mightily from China’s purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit.
It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future.
The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao’s recent visit to Washington, both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance.
That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy.
BRUSSELS – At the beginning of the financial crisis, it was said that banks were, in Charles Goodhart’s crisp phrase, “international in life, but national in death.”
At the time (2008-2009), large international banks had to be rescued by their home countries’ governments when they ran into trouble.
But the problem now in Europe is the opposite: banks are “national in life, but European in death.”
In Spain, for example, local savings banks (cajas) financed an outsize real-estate boom. As the boom turned to bust, the losses threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Spanish state, and the problem became European, because it threatened the very survival of the euro.
The Spanish case is symptomatic of a larger problem.
National supervisors always tend to minimize problems at home. Their instinct (and their bureaucratic interest) is to defend their countries’ “national champion” bank(s) abroad.
But their resistance to recognizing problems at home runs even deeper.
Until recently, the Spanish authorities maintained that the problems in their country’s real-estate sector were temporary.
To acknowledge the truth would have meant admitting that for years they had overlooked the build-up of an unsustainable construction boom that now threatens to bankrupt the entire country.
In the case of Ireland, the situation was initially not much different.
When problems started to surface, the finance minister at the time initially claimed that the country would carry out “the cheapest bank rescue ever.”
Given national supervisors’ predictable tendency not to recognize problems at home, it seemed natural that the cost of cleaning up insolvent banks should also be borne at the national level.
It thus seemed to make sense that even in the eurozone, banking supervision remained largely national.
The recently created European Banking Authority has only limited powers over national supervisors, whose daily work is guided mainly by national considerations.
But reality has shown that this approach is not tenable.
Problems might originate at the national level, but, owing to monetary union, they quickly threaten the stability of the entire eurozone banking system.
At their June summit, Europe’s leaders finally recognized the need to rectify this situation, transferring responsibility for banking supervision in the eurozone to the European Central Bank.
Given that financial integration is particularly strong within the monetary union, putting the ECB in charge was an obvious choice.
Moreover, the ECB already bears de facto responsibility for the stability of the eurozone’s banking system. But, until now, it had to lend massive amounts to banks without being able to judge their soundness, because all of that information was in the hands of national authorities who guarded it jealously and typically denied problems until it was too late.
Putting the ECB in charge should also help to stop the creeping disintegration process, which is not publicly visible, but is very real nonetheless. Just ask any of the large international banking groups headquartered in financially stressed eurozone countries.
Consider the case of a bank headquartered in Italy, but with an important subsidiary in Germany.
The German operations naturally generate a surplus of funds (given that savings in Germany far exceed investment on average).
The parent bank would like to use these funds to reinforce the group’s liquidity.
But the German supervisory authorities consider Italy at risk and thus oppose any transfer of funds there.
The supervisor of the home country (Italy) has the opposite interest.
It would like to see the “internal capital market” operate as much as possible. Here, too, it makes sense to have the ECB in charge as a neutral arbiter with respect to these opposing interests.

But, while putting the ECB in charge of banking supervision solves one problem, it creates another: can national authorities still be held responsible for saving banks that they no longer supervise?
Economic (and political) logic requires that the eurozone will soon also need a common bank rescue fund. Officially, this has not yet been acknowledged.
But that is often the way that European integration proceeds: an incomplete step in one area later requires further steps in related areas.
This incremental approach has worked well in the past; indeed, today’s European Union resulted from it. But a financial crisis does not give policymakers the time that they once had to explain to voters why one step required another.
They will have to walk much more quickly to save the euro.
HONG KONG – A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades.
Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated, rebuilt by the German peoples' hard work and sacrifice to unify the country, and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I was there to attend.
The conference’s theme was “Paradigm Lost,” with more than 300 economists, political scientists, systems analysts, and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality, rising unemployment, global financial disarray, and climate change.
Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it.
Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political, economic, social, and intellectual.
The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer, owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge.
And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental shifts.
In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic.
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.
By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles.
Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps.
Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause.
Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time.
Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption.
European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy.
Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty.
This “predetermined equilibrium” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-correct – led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes’s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction.
By the 1970’s, the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that “finance is a veil,” thereby becoming blind to financial markets’ destabilizing effects.
Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession’s push for free markets and minimal government intervention.
But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee.
Even as the world’s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance, four billion of the world’s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status, making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability.
New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world.
A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East.
In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:
“As the world enters the modern era, most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce.…This is easier said than done.
The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them.
Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.”
Using this macro-historical framework, we can see Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new, multipolar global system.
We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (the narrowing of income, wealth, and knowledge gaps between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth, and knowledge gaps within countries).
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.
As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it: “Security and justice require centralized governmental control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective.
Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.”
A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking.
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.
Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and social harmony without sacrifice – a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations.
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.
Europe could use it.
To many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true.
When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago, expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people.
Until recently, Russia's robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle, because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called "near abroad" as a zone of special interest and influence.
NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's "zone."
It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated.
By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics, Europe is made a safer place, and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire.
Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities.
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement.
Rightly so: enlargement of NATO is not an "expansion" that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms.
On the contrary, expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union.
The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, due in no small part to NATO demands.
Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia, Europe, and America now work out their disagreements.
Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU.
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper.
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime.
This, in turn, created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia.
When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002.
But this is no cause for complacency. For the really hard work is only now beginning: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring, as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms, in particular Russia.
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety.
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly.
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave.
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures.
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.
In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU, where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea.
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself.
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams.
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true.
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe.
In 1977, when I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department, I was sent to India to dissuade that country's leaders from developing a nuclear bomb.
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China.
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe.
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology.
So far as we know, its leaders have kept their word. But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's bomb, confirm the danger I predicted back then.
Some call Khan's network an effort to spread an "Islamic bomb," but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran, it might better be termed a corrupt bomb.
As events in Pakistan illustrate, the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence.
Rather, it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons.
That makes everyone less safe.
Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any city they chose.
Now the world's attention is focussed on Iran, one recipient of Pakistani technology, as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal.
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August, and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities.
Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium.
Last October, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures.
In addition, after visits by the French, British, and German foreign ministers, Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program.
Now it hints that it may resume enrichment, and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA.
Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.
Correct, because the NPT was born with a loophole.
Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections, it can legally accumulate enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program, and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice.
If Iran did this, it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region, but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide.
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others.
For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable.
However, America's unilateral options are limited.
Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq, but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility, making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions.
Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent.
In the mid-1970's, many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime, countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan formed a "Nuclear Suppliers Group" that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities.
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it.
Today, such countries should join together to offer Iran (and others) a deal.
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel.
For example, Russia, which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor's spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing.
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council.
The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions.
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle.
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear.
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan.
NEW YORK – The G-8’s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group’s recent summit in L’Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty.
With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar.
Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 .
During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers.
They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity.
As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence.
Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty.
It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap.
The UN Millennium Project’s Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle.
The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs.  The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose.  Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries.
Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years.
The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others.
Now the key is to make this effort work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.
Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children’s health and education.
That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating.
Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness.
A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain.
Perhaps the main risk is that the “aid bureaucracies” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings.
“Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action.
If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome.
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.
Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers.
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.
Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed.
Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated.
This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound.
Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases.
Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance.
Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach.
All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor.
Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works.
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.
NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene.
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused. He was then told to identify himself.
The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him.
He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification.
The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct.
We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed. 
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.
Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast.
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.
That, too, would not have been unusual.
What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances.
He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama.
That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him.
Class and race overlap in the US.
In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart.
Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice.
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.
As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck.
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates.
A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates.
As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president.
The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all.
The field is too full of mines.
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID.
It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city.
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
One might argue that itwas. If not Professor Gates, then who?
Precisely because he is a grandee, he is in the position to draw national attention to a serious issue.
If the same thing had happened to an unknown man in Harlem, or some other poor, or predominantly black district, no one would ever have heard about it.
The fact that it happened to a professor in Cambridge makes everyone sit up and take notice.
There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race.
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.
Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance.
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin.
There was no question of violence.
There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop.
Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore.
PARIS &#45;&#45; Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country’s most-eligible-bachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodel-turned-pop-musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney, he’s run into trouble. 
His ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time.
Older French citizens don’t find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing.
Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament. 
Likewise, India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy’s impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country’s Republic Day celebrations on January 26.
Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a first lady would?
Meanwhile, the same hard-right Hindu groups that protest Valentine’s Day as a decadent Western holiday have warned that if Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow, they’ll be out in the streets to welcome him.
This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a much-heralded summit between two of the world’s great democracies.
With lucrative deals at stake for the big-ticket products that drive the French economy – military hardware, nuclear power plants, and Airbus planes – France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India.
So, as rumors fly of secret marriage ceremonies either already concluded or in the works, could the trouble brewing in India over the French president’s very public love life be behind the rush to have the couple legally wed?
The news in Sarkozy’s favored media outletJournal du Dimanche that the couple plan to marry touched off a flurry of fevered speculation on when the happy event might occur.
The couple exchanged significant tokens of their mutual affection: he offered her a heart-shaped pink diamond ring by Dior, she offered him a Swiss watch.
It’s “serious,” the smitten president admitted. But he refused, even under direct questioning by reporters, to reveal an exact date.
“You’ll probably find out after it’s happened,” he taunted.
Rumor has it the couple has set February 8 or 9 for the wedding.   Others say that Sarkozy has already outsmarted the media by secretly marrying in the Elysee Palace, even as he was dodging wedding questions.
If that is true, then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime.
If the couple sizzled for cameras with Luxor and Petra as the backdrop, just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic spot on Earth, the Taj Mahal. And, given the current rage for all things Bollywood in France, a lavish Indian wedding would be fitting.
Bruni’s own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.
A comely brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.
The Indian government will be nothing if not relieved to see the first girlfriend made a wife.
As one of India’s leading daily newspapers, theIndian Express, spelled it out, lest anyone be confused, “a girlfriend is not a wife or spouse.”
Once wed, all protocol worries about the French delegation would simply disappear.
Despite the sometimes downright pornographic on-screen writhing of Bollywood starlets, India is still a deeply conservative society. Divorce is anathema.
(Sarkozy is now twice divorced.)
And, while mistresses abound among the privileged classes, they do not strut publicly by their power-mates’ sides.
Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo.
In this respect, India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one.
Most Indians, as it seems many French, would prefer not to shed the “hypocrisy” Sarkozy laments on the part of his predecessors (read: former French President François Mitterrand, who had a child with his mistress about whom the public knew nothing until the man’s funeral).
Sarkozy, of all people, should know that a large part of the gravitas of office derives from pomp and circumstance.
Statecraft is a realm where appearances are meant to be deceiving.
When Sarkozy, who otherwise has such finely tuned media instincts, protests that he’s no different from any other man, he comes dangerously close to confusing the office and the person of the president.
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India.
Sarkozy could make that dream come true.
If he really is as head-over-heels in love with Bruni as he claims, and plans to marry her imminently, why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to India and make this a wedding to remember?
He could meet his bride seated majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant, and she would look ravishing swathed and bejeweled in Indian finery.
The “bling-bling” president, as Sarkozy has been dubbed, can wear all the gold he wants and heap yet more diamonds on his bride. 
The cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams.
And if it’s too late for the wedding, there’s always the reception.
BERLIN – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap.
Indeed, the opposite is true.
Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most menacing of all, the risk of military proliferation.
Moreover, the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable.
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity; it is a deliberate political choice.
Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that, at the time, only a minority of people worldwide, largely in the West, benefited from technological progress.
By contrast, the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources, which are indispensable for human survival, are finite, and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have.
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
The energy future of nine billion people, which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century, lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency.
We already know this.
Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?
The answer, ultimately, doesn’t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications.
The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb.
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige.
Even today, the Bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states have it, and the many that do not.
The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union.
To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers, which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was framed in the 1960’s. To this day, it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves.
Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it.
To this day, therefore, the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase, particularly given small and medium powers’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts.
Iran is the most current example of this.
The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists.
Despite the NPT, a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn’t always worked, or worked completely, because the NPT’s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes.
From here, then, all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders’ decision to take them.
This political power, not the requirements of energy policy, is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult.
As a rule, the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “civilian” nuclear programs.
The supposed “civilian” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus, for instance, led to a large number of such “civilian” programs in neighboring states.
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
And, of course, the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “clandestine threshold countries.”
So how will the world – first and foremost, the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster?
Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible?
Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice.
It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the latter-day Soviet Union) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks.
What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?
Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course.
Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation.
WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS – Born in 1957, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now more than 50 years old, and the European Commission is proposing what it calls a health check for its middle-aged child.
But superficial repairs will not meet the European Union’s future needs.
The CAP must be born again.
Work on its renewal is due to start now, with the completed project ready in 2013.
But a much more profound re-think is needed.
The CAP’s original aim was to provide a secure source of food for the six original member states of the Union, which were importers of food and sought a degree of self-sufficiency.
Good, healthy, and cheap food had to be accessible for all citizens.
Improved agricultural productivity would benefit rural areas and give farmers a comparative share in the Union’s growing wealth.
Instruments to achieve those objectives were developed, and food security was achieved.
The CAP quickly came to be seen as the jewel in the crown of the European project.
As the EU has evolved and expanded, food systems have become more complex, involving production, processing, supply-chain organization, and wholesale and retail distribution, with all of these involving new issues like health and the environment.
The use of land is also receiving more serious scrutiny.
A 1991 study by the Netherlands Scientific Council for Governmental Policy, entitledGround for Choices, demonstrated that the EU’s food supply could be met with 50% less cultivated land, 80% less pesticides, and at 50% less cost.
Pollution would be reduced by 70% as a result of fewer nitrates in the surface water, and greenhouse gases would be cut.
Those figures were for an EU of 15 countries, so with today’s 27 members the possibilities are even greater.
A Dutch analysis of land use has shown that by employing the best technical and ecological means on the best available land, substantial gains could be made in food production.
So it is not surprising that the number of farmers needed has fallen substantially.
Viewed from the standpoint of food security and the wealth of rural areas, there is now an urgent need to revisit the CAP’s main instruments so that a new policy formula can be introduced.
Perverse subsidies must be removed and recent new ones favoring products such as bio-fuels reconsidered.
Thestatus quo clearly has to be changed.
Rural policy in the EU is too often reduced to income guarantees for the farming community.
But that attitude is undermining change.
Competition must be encouraged, as more rural entrepreneurship will strengthen the farming community, with fewer farmers but better farms.
A simplified CAP would encourage cleaner, more productive, and efficient agriculture.
A side benefit for the EU’s standing in the world could be that the World Trade Organization’s stalled Doha negotiations could be restarted once farmers in developing countries are assured of getting a fair deal from Europe.
Moreover, the CAP’s role as a motor of political and social integration in Europe could be restored once renewed policies are in place.
But renewal of this sort cannot be left to global market forces, as the results might not necessarily benefit European agriculture and society.
If the market “misbehaves,” farmers could be reduced to poverty, leading to the neglect of large areas of Europe.
That is a real enough danger to which policymakers must give serious thought as they reform the CAP on the basis of the following five pillars.
1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The EU needs a knowledge and innovation policy that strengthens European agriculture’s competitiveness.
Such a policy has been successful in the Netherlands, substantially contributing to the development and power of the country’s agribusiness.
Ten of 21 branches of Dutch agribusiness, including horticultural seeds, ornamentals, seed potatoes, and veal, are among the top contributors to the national economy and the country’s trade balance.
In the EU as a whole, a policy directed toward research programs stimulating scientific excellence and greater coherence in the European knowledge system would greatly strengthen agriculture’s competitiveness and contribute to food security and sustainable development.
2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Europe also needs a restructuring policy for land use.
Many structural improvement programs have been financed at the European level, but agricultural production and land use are not among them.
The development of an Agricultural Main Structure would compliment the European Ecological Main Structure.
Reforestation and the repair of natural ecosystems should also be part of a land use policy.
3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A policy for European food systems would treat production, processing, distribution, logistics, and retailing in combination.
Consumption patterns and preferences are an integral part of such systems.
Preliminary studies by the European Science Foundation’s “Forward Look on European Food Systems” could prove useful in devising an EU-wide policy.
4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Metropolitan agriculture in a rapidly urbanizing world can provide high-quality produce on small amounts of land.
It offers an answer to rising demand for healthy food with minimal environmental side effects.
5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A new CAP should include a policy to safeguard Europe’s landscapes.
But a cultural heritage should not be maintained everywhere, nor should it ignore cost.
And it should not be a defensive policy of the sort that tends to concentrate on poor-quality land.
These five pillars involve drastic choices, but they will probably require less money from Europe’s taxpayers, not more.
They could make a real contribution to cleaner, more productive, and efficient farming and land use, while addressing social needs.
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap.
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.
Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers.
The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs.
African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily.
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it.
With donor help, they can.
Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future.
By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own.
There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa.
The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training.
In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production.
Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor.
This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution.
These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be.
Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them.
Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding.
These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP).
But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used.
Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger.
Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so.
The current aid structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate.
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.
African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds.
My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM).
These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need.
Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors.
By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help. 
The time for business as usual is over.
The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track.
Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course.
Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day.
We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success.
History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis.
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.
CAMBRIDGE – With youth unemployment touching 50% in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable?
If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.
The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders.
At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone.
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?
In his provocative American Economic Review paper “A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas,” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were, the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment.
He credited another (future) Nobel Prize winner, James Meade, for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently, especially in the context of Europe’s nascent integration.
Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever.
Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region.
Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau. Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States.
Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain.
Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%.
Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration.
Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960’s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk.
For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions.
In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country.
Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent.
Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets.
This claim was hugely misguided.
Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy.
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.
But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time.
Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube, much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century.
Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification.
Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort.
Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant.
Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities.
A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even of Mundell’s labor-mobility criterion, is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving region-wide popular elections.
Europe’s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.
European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine.
Perhaps they are right. But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones.
Europe may never be an “optimum” currency area by any standard.
But, without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade.
PRAGUE – On Christmas Day last year, one of China’s best-known human rights activists, the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was condemned to 11 years in prison.
Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77, calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution, and demanding the open election of public officials, freedom of religion and expression, and the abolition of “subversion” laws.
For his bravery and clarity of thought about China’s future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award.
First and foremost, he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights. Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years.
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless.
These ideals – respect for human rights and human dignity, and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights – represent humanity’s highest aspirations.
Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu’s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals, it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu’s 11-year sentence.
It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting.
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel’s original intent for the award.
In working to promote human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago.
Of course, democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage. But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state’s foreign and domestic policies.
This active and searching conversation, the hallmark of a democratic polity, is the best hope for better decisions by governments, both at home and abroad.
Liu’s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is, above all, intended for the benefit of the Chinese people. But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China’s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, an independent media, and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box.
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.
In conferring on Liu one of the world’s highest honors, the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and world peace and international solidarity on the other.
Liu’s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure, a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path.
We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement, such as Liu’s, requires an exemplary response.
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves.
ITHACA – With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year’s resounding political transformations.
From the dramatic events in the Middle East, to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India, leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything.
They ignore this message at their peril.
Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000’s, and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse. But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum.
Corruption takes many forms, but, in emerging markets, a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes.
Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries; indeed, it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival.
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects.
In India, for example, the government lost as much as $30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction.
For ordinary people, large-scale corruption is less visible, because, while the sums involved are mind-boggling, the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft. But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality.
In countries like China and India, rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty. But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared – the rich become super-rich, even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute.
Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets, but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains.
In many emerging markets, a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix.
The combination of corruption, inequality, and political repression builds up enormous pressure, and there are no institutional channels through which to release it.
But freer political regimes are not a panacea.
In a democracy like India’s, the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth, thus increasing the resentment of those left behind.
The opportunity to “throw the rascals out” in each election cycle helps to let off some steam, but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it.
It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest, but economic factors are key.
For example, rising food prices tend to hurt the poor, especially the urban poor, who spend a large share of their income on food; unlike agricultural workers, they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices.
With swelling urban populations, it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures.
Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression, information blackouts, or a combination of authoritarian measures.
China, for example, blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests.
The Arab Spring, however, reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows.
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability.
Even with rapid increases in national income, if these countries’ leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly, they will become vulnerable to popular discontent.
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability.
These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps, and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being.
Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment, strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable, and improving educational access and quality.
These lessons apply equally to advanced economies, which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption. But, for those wealthy economies, restoring decent growth is now the major priority.
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption.
As the past year’s events have shown, the costs of inaction could be calamitous.
OXFORD – In Anthony Burgess’s novella (and Stanley Kubrick’s film) A Clockwork Orange, Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images.
Like Pavlov’s dog, Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex.
This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged.
The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired, and the fear that science will be used to make, or even force, people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned.
Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife.
Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “clockwork” that underlies human morality.
They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions.
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it.
Indeed, scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity.
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others.
Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray, it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders.
Neuroscientists have even magnetically “zapped” carefully targeted areas of people’s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example, making it easier for them to lie.
Of course, no one is developing a “moral pill” that will transform us into saints.
But the research is advancing fast, and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, sentiments, and motivations.
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better?
A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch.
But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex.
I suspect that many will agree with this view. They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard, not a broken clock that scientists should fix.
Of course, most of us don’t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture.
But this does not mean that we are morally good, or good enough.
As you read this, perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others.
Even in the most advanced and affluent societies, a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency: think of locks, security alarms, police, courts, and prisons.
And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others, or give enough to the less fortunate.
Humans are born with the capacity to be moral, but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world.
For thousands of years, humans have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to make people behave decently.
We could all be morally better, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further.
It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments.
So we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance, by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more persuasive ethical arguments.
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion.
Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens’ moral code – we know that if they had such power, they would misuse it.
It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy, or, yes, by taking a ’morality’ pill.
But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better.
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.
And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who would want it least.
These are, of course, hypothetical questions.
We don’t yet know what is possible. But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late.
And even if “moral pills” are just science fiction, they raise deep questions.
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
PRINCETON – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped, but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed.
Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban, or was it a reflection of the hardship, both personal and economic, that the ban was causing?
Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, at a cost to airlines of more than $1 billion.
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.
The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected.
Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income.
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.
In the past, jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, and in one case, dropped thousands of feet, although all managed to land safely.
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.
The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft, and that no matter how slight that risk might be, the government’s job was, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it, “to make sure that safety was paramount.”
Indeed, in closing their skies, European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else.
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas.
Some 3,000 people die on the world’s roads every day.
Cutting speed limits to, say, 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives.
We don’t do it, because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving.
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.
It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals.
The British government uses a figure of a little more than £1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example, by improving road safety.
In the US, the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $5.8 million – nearly four times as much, at current exchange rates – for the same purpose.
Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US, but not in Britain?
Giovanni Bisignani, the head of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown, saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken.
On the whole, though, the public seemed to support the decision.
Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky.
But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?
John Stuart Mill, in his classic book On Liberty, considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe.
In Mill’s view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger.
Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make, because only he can judge the importance of his journey, and balance that against the risk he is running.
Air safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew.
If they are fully informed of the risks, and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money, as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly?
In the end, after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage, and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere, Europe’s skies were reopened.
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly.
Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety, we know that this is not only a technical question.
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question: how safe should we aim to be?
PRINCETON – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia’s leaders have not changed a whit.
It looks increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news for decades to come.
According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies.
Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics.
In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin’s men designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their ur-enemy.
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police; its leaders arrested and beaten; Putin called its supporters “coyotes.”
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger.
Oil prices are soaring, as are Putin’s approval ratings.
His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee.
Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies, the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents, and the massive “social investments” of recent years, which, under Medvedev’s personal supervision, have bribed the population, no credible force can seriously challenge Putin’s men.
Yet their regime is in crisis, and they know it.
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been reversed.
Despite increasing incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power; they still die at a shockingly young age.
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.
State monopolies undo what private businesses created.
With more money, ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to rule the country.
The country is unruly, and its rulers know it.
So they panic.
Putin’s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia’s security forces.
His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “directed and controlled,” including the KGB.
Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge.
Its people have become powerful, arrogant, and enormously rich.
They have also become disobedient.
In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin’s representative in northwest Russia, published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country.
This essay, more than anything else, defined Putin’s second term.
In October 2007, Cherkesov (now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services, the Federal Anti-Drug Administration) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues’ degradation: warriors had turned into traders, he complained.
Earlier, generals from a competing service, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov’s deputy for “illegal bugging.”
In a public gesture of despair, Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin’s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services.
Cherkesov’s deputy remains in prison.
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense.
In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading, applying force when a trade did not go well.
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin’s circle also confronts this situation.
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another?
Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.
But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones.
Now that Putin’s people have left their predecessors’ neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique, the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services, the administration, business, and much else.
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction.
Preaching nationalism, its managers will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism.
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree.
Putin’s lawyers will reverse that decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, corporation, military unit, university department, etc. Integrated by the leader’s charisma and party discipline, party members will direct and unify the desolated country.
This is Putin’s plan.
Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party’s general secretary.
As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin.
And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit.
In the end, Putin has what history left him: not ideas, just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power.
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality; Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party.
It is a bizarre ideology.
Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, it shuns its Marxist origins.
It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies.
LONDON – Last month, while in New York City, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
To accommodate his security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself.
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks.
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days.
The Israelis refused; another impasse was reached.
What, then, might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land?
The answer is: very poor.
All peace efforts since the Oslo accords of 1993 have been based on the “two-state solution,” according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state, and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after.
A negotiated “land for peace” solution still remains official Western doctrine.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech, “a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace” has to be based on “two states for two peoples.”
Meanwhile, the two main parties to the dispute, Palestine and Israel, are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied “peace process.”
The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood, while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that, if the latest peace talks collapse, he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders.
This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized “Palestine,” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow.
Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe, and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between.
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy.
Israel’s main concern continues to be security.
The official Western doctrine is that Israel’s long-term security depends on the success of the “peace process.”
In practice, Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future.
Media attention has been focused on the “security wall,” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence.
But, to the hawks who now control Israeli politics, the key to Israel’s security depends on depth of defense, for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable.
The hawks’ recipe for survival is threefold: continued military and economic support from the US, defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program, and the carve-up of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans, or subordinate authorities, incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy.
Thus, while Abbas seeks to create a new “fact on the ground” by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state, Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable.
The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states, but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state.
Indeed, the two-state solution was always an illusion.
There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it. And, over time, Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs.
Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper.
These are the “facts on the ground” that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state.
Moreover, land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view.
If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle, there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety, poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid.
Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories, with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes.
The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP.
It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers’ productivity and taxes. But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one.
The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories. But it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy, implicitly backed by the US, will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism.
The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states, so Netanyahu’s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas’s pursuit of statehood through international recognition.
Netanyahu’s project is not moral. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t work, at least for a time.
Time is running out in Kosovo.
If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December, the province’s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally – a move that the United States has announced it may support.
That would be a disastrous step.
Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo’s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire.
Serbia is even more strongly opposed.
Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia’s state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty.
Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 “military observers” and 2,116 policemen) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous.
After eight years of international administration, Kosovo’s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence.
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.
Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro.
Serbia is prepared to concede only “enhanced autonomy” to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements.
Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise.
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.
By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene.
It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals (for example, admission and circulation of foreigners, or extradition), plus the right to seek admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence).
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.
However, a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defence, borders (in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo’s Serbian minority.
As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects, bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body.
Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government’s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, whereas the Kosovar government’s “sovereignty” over Kosovo would be restrained.
To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions, the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates, and three representatives of the EU, thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates.
In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (say, 5,000 troops) to back up the common body’s decisions.
As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement.
Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority.
Kosovo would acquire limited independence, with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN.
The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area.
Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent.
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.
Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as occurred in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or, pushed by centrifugal forces, split up (as with the United Arab Republic, established in 1958, which split three years later into Egypt and Syria).
The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage (lasting five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent.
Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo’s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing “sovereign authority” with other independent states, which could deflate Kosovars’ dangerously robust nationalistic demands.
NEW YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory?
Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation, documentation, and inference that takes shape – usually on the Internet – and spreads virally around the globe.
In the process, conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse, where they were generally consigned in the past, and sometimes into the very heart of politics.
I learned this by accident.
Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation.
There are some major themes.
A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting – via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others – to establish a “One World Government” dominated by themselves rather than national governments.
Sometimes, more folkloric details come into play, broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes Scholars, or, as always, the Jews.
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis.
In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims.
Historically, there tends to be the same set of themes: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans.
Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks – rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse – primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering.
Similarly, the “9/11 Truth Movement” asserts that al-Qaeda’s attack on the Twin Towers was an “inside job.”
In the Muslim world, there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks, and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day.
Usually, conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking.
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays?
Today’s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly designated “enemy” with an unmistakable “plan” is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings – or failures – of unfettered capitalism.
And, while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they address are often healthy, even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong.
In seeking answers, these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities.
Many citizens believe, rightly, that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses.
Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding, and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut.
Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust, setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum.
Likewise, in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies, many people believe, again rightly, that their elected officials no longer represent them.
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.
Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because, in the last eight years, we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies.
The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war, using fabricated evidence to do so.
Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque?
When even the 9/11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence derived from torture), is it surprising that many want a second investigation?
Frequently enough, it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse – pursuing such theories – who report on news that the mainstream media ignores.
For example, it took a “conspiracy theorist,” Alex Jones, to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens. The New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source.
The mainstream media’s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias.
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow.
So even good, critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists.
The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview, and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions.
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia.
In a fevered environment, without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing, citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues, as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin’s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists.
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
Citizens should be able more easily to leak information, pitch stories, and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters.
They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting, unmediated by corporate pressures.
And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and eschewing anonymity – that is, standing by their own bylines, as conventional reporters do.
This is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation.
In a time of official lies, healthy investigative energy should shed light, not just generate heat.
Changing constitutions is always a risky business. But it is a downright dangerous one when undertaken to benefit one man alone.
Indeed, when a president volunteers to reduce the powers of his own office, you can be certain that he is up to no good.
That is exactly what is going on in Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma proposes to junk our presidential system and replace it with a strange type of parliamentary system he has concocted.
Kuchma has not suddenly converted to the view that parliamentary democracies are better than presidential ones.
No, Kuchma wants to change Ukraine's constitution for no other reason than to maintain his grip on power.
Today, Kuchma rules as an all-powerful president.
But his term ends next year and he cannot run again. So, instead of retiring gracefully, as presidents from Bill Clinton to Boris Yeltsin routinely do, Kuchma wants to change the constitution in order to become an all-powerful prime minister who will never face a limit on the length of his term.
Of course, constitutions are not meant to protect the status quo if the status quo is rotten.
Constitutions can, and should, accommodate reform when necessary.
A powerful president, however, is not necessarily wrong for Ukraine.
In our wrenching postcommunist transition, it is essential that a government can act decisively.
To change a system that seems best suited to Ukraine's circumstances, you need a good reason.
The Ukraine president is authorized to appoint and sack the prime minister, dissolve parliament if he wishes, and rule by decree if he judges that the country's institutions are in danger.
He maintains day-to-day control over every aspect of government.
Sopuissant a Caesar must be above reproach.
Kuchma is not.
On the contrary, what is rotten in Ukraine is not its constitution, but its president, who is mired in charges of corruption and orchestrating the murder of journalists, and who is shunned by other world leaders.
As president, Kuchma is grotesquely unpopular.
Even Slobodan Milosevic had more support in Yugoslavia before his fall.
So Kuchma knows that he cannot rely on handpicking his successor, as Yeltsin did in Russia.
Unable to assure himself of a tame presidential successor, Kuchma wants what he calls a "parliamentary republic" with a weak president and powerful prime minister.
But the parliament he has in mind is a mutant, one where the authoritarian rule of the criminal clans Kuchma controls will continue, unabated, behind the facade of parliamentary procedure.
People too easily forget Ukraine, this big country on the border of the soon-to-be enlarged European Union.
But any attempt to prolong Kuchma's rule will create such a political mess that it is not absurd to fear that Ukraine could follow Belarus and the Balkans of the early 1990's into outright dictatorship and chaos.
Indeed, this scenario could worsen, because Russia is unlikely to sit around idly and watch Ukraine unravel.
Intervention of some type seems more likely in such circumstances.
Only an imperial Russia, however, would dare reabsorb Ukraine.
But an imperial Russia cannot be a democratic Russia.
So Kuchma endangers freedom and human rights not only in Ukraine, but ultimately threatens Russia's democracy as well.
Luckily, there has never been a better time for the West--particularly the EU--to nudge Ukraine back from the brink.
With EU expansion coming next spring, all Ukrainians fear that a new wall will cut their country off from the Union's easternmost border in Poland.
Although the job of maintaining Ukraine's democracy is primarily one for Ukrainians, the EU can help if it takes practical steps to reassure Ukrainians that they won't be cut off from the rest of Europe.
A generous visa regime and the use of regional development funds in Ukraine that will benefit impoverished eastern Poland, are two possible inducements. But these should be made conditional on Kuchma leaving the country's constitution and democracy alone.
The EU should not fret about interfering in Ukraine's domestic affairs.
After all, it hesitated little a few years ago to put a current member state, Austria, on notice that it was watching out for the welfare of that country's democracy.
The wayward Kuchma is far more deserving of Europe imposing safeguards to ensure his good behavior.
Similarly, the US should cast a wary eye at Kuchma's decision to send troops to Iraq.
It cannot be the case that America's fidelity to democracy in Ukraine can be so cynically purchased.
Within Ukraine, a government capable of truly governing should seek to adopt EU laws and norms in exactly the manner that the countries poised to join the Union have done, thus helping to clean up the murky system in which Kuchma's criminal cronies flourish.
The constitution must be reformed, but not to shift power from one unaccountable leader to another.
What is needed are clear checks on arbitrary rule, and transparency in decision-making.
No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power, no matter what.
Less certain is whether he will feel secure enough to hold a presidential election (or any other kind of election) if he cannot change the constitution in a way that guarantees his continued misrule.
It is, after all, President Kuchma who is discredited, not Ukraine's constitutional arrangements.
NEW YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession: it is mainly Europe and the United States, not the major emerging markets, that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment.
And it is Europe and America that are marching, alone and together, to the denouement of a grand debacle.
A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession, but that also fueled substantial budget deficits.
The response – massive spending cuts – ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment (a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering) will continue, possibly for years.
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members.
It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro’s very survival was in growing jeopardy.
Europe’s leaders recognized that distressed countries’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow, and that growth could not be achieved without assistance.
But, even as Europe’s leaders promised that help was on the way, they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending.
The resulting austerity will hinder Europe’s growth, and thus that of its most distressed economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners.
And low growth will hurt tax revenues, undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation.
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank’s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece’s bad sovereign debt, for fear that any private-sector involvement (PSI) would trigger a “credit event,” which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps (CDSs), possibly fueling further financial turmoil.
But, if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital.
Likewise, the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage to ratings agencies’ decisions about what constitutes a “credit event.”
Indeed, one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies.
Indeed, the most curious aspect of the ECB’s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event.
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable.
If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, surely they were safer after the restructuring, and thus equally acceptable.
This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions, with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend to be captured (at least “cognitively”) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate.
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic.
There, the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government, confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don’t get their way confront rational individuals, the former prevail.
As a result, President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy, with no tax increases – not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades, and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies, which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation.
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America’s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year.
But the payroll-tax cut (which put more than $100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans) was not renewed, and surely business, anticipating the contractionary effects down the line, will be even more reluctant to lend.
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary.
And, with housing prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment remaining stubbornly high (one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one), more stimulus, not austerity, is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well.
The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues, owing to poor economic performance; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work.
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction.
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
After all, America’s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe’s problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US – especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs.
But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas move easily across borders, and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other.
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring.
The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming, and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences.
Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank, the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming, but whether we can afford not to.
The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater.
The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought.
Indeed, the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs: for instance, climate change may lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream – of particular concern to Europe – and a flourishing of disease.
When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution, that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases, and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels. But few saw, for instance, the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case.
Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing.
To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less.
As one scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail, and a fog bank rolls in, should you drive more or less cautiously?
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.
As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable.
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.
To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause.
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.
The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating.
A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate. This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes.
It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work.
Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, in this case he has called for voluntary action. But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits, regardless of the cost to others.
Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funded “research” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer.
Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean.
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol, and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries.
Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation.
Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference.
For example, simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning.
We have but one planet, and should treasure it.
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.
MUNICH – For a while, it looked as if the European Central Bank’s €1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe’s banking system had calmed global financial markets.
But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%.
Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable.
After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced.
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.
Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden.
The main problem is Spain, where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy combined, and, as in Greece, is in the neighborhood of 100% of GDP (93% to be precise).
A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain’s youth are unemployed, reflecting the country’s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period.
The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again.
Moreover, Spain’s debt with the ECB’s TARGET settlement system rose by €55 billion ($72 billion) between February and March, because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated.
Since July 2011, Spain’s TARGET debt has grown by €199 billion.
Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010.
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.
The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years.
The country’s TARGET debt grew by €76 billion from February to March, with the total since July 2011 reaching €276 billion.
Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB’s liquidity injection.
It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy, because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital.
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.
In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table.
Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly.
As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France’s TARGET debt increased by €95 billion.
France, too, has become uncompetitive, owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years.
According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the country’s price level must drop by an estimated 20% vis-à-vis the euro average – that is, depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone.
Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%.
While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone.
These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation.
For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze.
There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels – bailout funds, eurobonds, or the ECB – from the eurozone’s healthy core to the troubled South.
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree.
Already German, Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to €15,000, €17,000, and €21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB.
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.
Above all, however, the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity, if not to Europe’s economic collapse, because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment.
Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system’s main steering mechanism.
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe’s politicians have started down this slippery slope.
LONDON – Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis.
That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed.
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.
But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all.
As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “Our distrust is very expensive.”
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: “It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance.
Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained.
Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment.
So if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust.
In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret.
In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous.
Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC.
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government.
The market will prove one side right before too long.
In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators.
Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior.
In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks.
So falling trust had real economic consequences.
Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply. This has been positive for the stock market.
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration’s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government’s ability to regulate.
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.
Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground.
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business.
Others are congenitally distrustful.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals’ income.
A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two.
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.
The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes.
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?
It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average.
In other words, if you diverge markedly from society’s average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused.
When anyone I don’t know says “trust me” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet.
Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same.
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much.
NEW HAVEN – Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes.
So, not surprisingly, economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end, either.
Of course, we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis: people are not spending, because their incomes have fallen, their jobs are insecure, or both.
But we can take it a step further back: people’s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on, backwards in time, in a repeating feedback loop.
It is a vicious circle, but where and why did it start? Why did it worsen?
What will reverse it?
It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers.
The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash.
Economists did not predict that event, either.
In the 1920’s, some warned about an overpriced stock market, but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy.
Late in the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden inThe Christian Science Monitor reported an informal set of interviews with US “professors, banking experts, union leaders, and representatives of business associations and political factions,” all of whom were given the same question: “What causes recessions?”
The multiplicity of answers seemed bewildering, and did not inspire confidence that anyone knew what was causing the deepest crisis of capitalism.
The causes given were “distributed widely among government, labor, industry, international politics and policies.”
They included misguided government interference with markets, high income and capital gains taxes, mistaken monetary policy, pressures towards high wages, monopoly, overstocked inventories, uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court, rearmament in Europe and fear of war, government encouragement of labor disputes, a savings glut because of population shrinkage, the passing of the frontier, and easy credit before the depression.
Although economic theory today is much improved, if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers.
We would certainly hear some new ones, too: unprecedented real-estate bubbles, a global savings glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, sub-prime mortgages, unregulated over-the-counter markets, rating agencies’ errors, compromised real-estate appraisals, and complacency about counterparty risk.
More likely than not, many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right, for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors, the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things, which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point.
At that point, the trouble grabbed widespread attention, destroyed public confidence, and set in motion a negative feedback loop.
Our attention, after all, is naturally drawn to the worst events.&nbsp;Precisely because the worst events are statistical outliers, their causes are probably multiple.
Consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which killed more than 200,000 people.
It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage.
But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage, one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors – including even political, financial, and insurance factors – that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis.
Indeed, the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes. For, in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways, events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon, which, by flapping its wings, sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane.
Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions, and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future.
Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future, either, but at least they have precise mathematical models.
Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics.&nbsp;Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather, even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far.
The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize.
The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects, but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid, immutable theory.
The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis, Carmen Reinhart’s and Kenneth Rogoff’sThis Time Is Different, is essentially a summary of lessons learned from virtually every financial crisis in every country in recorded history.
But the book is almost entirely non-theoretical.
It merely documents recurrent patterns.
Unfortunately, in 800 years of financial history, there is only one example of a really massive worldwide contraction, namely the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it is hard to know exactly what to expect in the current contraction based on the Reinhart-Rogoff analysis.
This leaves us trying to use patterns from past, dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis.
As a result, we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing.
CAMBRIDGE – Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates?
Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people’s feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that “the whole government is a Ponzi scheme.”
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008.
Personally, I suspect Madoff’s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while.
Still, with many of the world’s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented old-age pension obligations, and a downshift in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is.
In a new paper, “A Decade of Debt,” Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II.
Japan, of course, is in even worse shape, with government debt totaling more than 200% of GDP.
Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves, Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs – and this on top of its depressing demographic trends.
Many other rich countries’ debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs, despite relative peace in much of the world.
There is a no easy way out.
For now, low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, whereas real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise far more quickly, even for rich countries.
Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity.
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts.
In principle, an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts.
It is high time to consider novel approaches.
Of course, no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems. And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises.
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic.
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start.
A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
But, while these older institutions have proven enormously useful, they are typically quite constrained.
The CBO, for example, is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth, but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future “fixes” at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies.
To enhance credibility, a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence, often with central banks as a role model.
The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada.
The remit of Sweden’s fiscal council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to forecast, but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy.
In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis.
In the US, such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk.
It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least anytime soon.
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy. And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional.
Still, the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity.
Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are.
It will remain very tempting for each generation to say, “My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I, so who cares if they have to pay some debt?”
Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias, as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment.
To resist these powerful pressures, fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability.
To be sure, Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right, and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever. But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits.
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape.
The fall of Milosevic does not cure the political woes of the Balkans; indeed, it raises their urgency.
Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the disintegration is incomplete.
It was in Yugoslavia that Vojislav Kostunica was elected president, but his mandate comes solely from support in Serbia.
Montenegro, Serbia’s junior partner in the Yugoslav federation, mostly boycotted the election while Albanians in Kosovo ignored them.
Yet it was Yugoslavia, whose foundations are unstable, that was recently admitted to the UN.
A host of problems remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia’s northern province of Vojvodina).
Any resolution – any suggestion of change – will engender new conflicts because of conflicting claims of sovereignty.
However tempting it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new borders or establishing new entities, this conundrum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty.
That traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans.
A new approach is needed: the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as the way to promote regional integration.
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe.
This idea has great appeal to people in the region, but only the EU can make it happen.
After NATO intervention in Kosovo, European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans.
It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July, 1999.
But the Stability Pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content.
The time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November 24 called by France as the current EU president.
The European Union should now propose a three-point plan for the Balkans:
$ a customs union with preferential access to EU markets within one year.
The existing EU-Turkey customs union should be used as a model.
Once all these countries reach agreement with the EU there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans.
This will take some time to implement.
But from the start, the EU should give a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region.
This cannot endanger any EU interests as the countries at issue now have far less than 1% of the EU market.
$ a regional VAT to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years.
Differences in indirect taxes such as VAT pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade.
They should be unified throughout the region.
Regional VAT rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union.
$ Temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years, subject to EU supervision over budgetary expenditures.
Because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional VAT, the EU should provide financial help during the transition.
The area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo.
Participation by Romania and Moldova is optional.
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate provided it would not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership.
Depending on the country, there could be more or less budgetary support. (Bulgaria, for example, might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs).
In comparison to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping, the financial costs here are ridiculously low.
I estimate that Euro 750 million in the first year, Euro 500 million in the second year and Euro 250 million in the third year would do the trick. (If Romania and Moldova were included the figures would be slightly higher).
These figures are well within range of pledges already made by the EU for the Stability Pact and they could be easily accommodated within the confines of the Berlin Accord on the EU budget for 2000-2005 if EU member states agree to a reallocation of unspent funds.
Budgetary support in the context of a Customs Union would be a more effective way to disburse EU funds than conventional methods.
This three-point program would lay the ground for economic resurgence.
It would remove two major sources of corruption and inefficiency: the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general.
It would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment.
The Deutsche Mark, already widely used in the region, now functions as the de facto common currency.
Any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment.
Improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions, in turn, would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans.
Serbia has climbed part of the way out of the abyss.
Success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal.
But that process has a long way to go.
The opposition inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins.
The population, frustrated by ever deepening impoverishment and isolation, is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in Serbia.
People are asking about crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against Serbs.
They must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
Once that process is underway, many problems that now seem intractable will be resolved more easily.
Kostunica’s election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution: many of the old guard are still in place.
The momentum created by Milosevic’s overthrow needs to be maintained.
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia’s isolation.
Europe must now fulfill its promise.
If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb, an historic opportunity will be lost.
PRAGUE – As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union, I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain’s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as “a faraway country of which we know little.”
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld’s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between “new and old” Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude. 
The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was.
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old.
We Czechs are 100% European, and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe.
Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new.
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.
On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed.
The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU.
Unfortunately, conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve.
The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread, because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe’s young people, who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few.
It will fall to the Union, once again, to help transform despair into hope.
We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness.
To contain today’s financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point.
The very existence of our Union, and particularly of the euro, has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930’s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn. 
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check.
For now, EU governments’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals.
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times, its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro.
These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen.
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated.
Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year, but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold.
Now those talks have resumed, but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically.
Russia’s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members.
The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia’s budget, and lack of investment in the country’s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted.
Until now, Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU, because two-thirds of Russia’s exports to the Union comprise natural resources, which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides.
Given the stark changes in economic conditions, however, it is now in Russia’s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business, for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal.
Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia. Indeed, many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia’s closest friend in the Union.
But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members, and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole.  Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia. 
Europe’s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism, important as that undoubtedly is, but its unity.
When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe united around a single position on Russia’s withdrawal.
It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward.
During the 1990’s, the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect.  It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms.
We, like all EU presidencies, will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate.
SEOUL – It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country’s next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) to be the leading candidate.
If elected, she would be South Korea’s first woman president, and, for her rivals, her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact.
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country’s leadership.
Her political style is both refreshing and relevant, because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership. And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately, which she likely learned – along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue – from her father, former President Park Chung-hee.
Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right-wingers, the iron-fisted Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979, in the wake of the 1961 military coup, only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief.
His daughter is proud of his legacy, which marked the beginning of South Korea’s economic boom.
Indeed, as a pillar of export-oriented modernity, Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states.
At home, he still ranks first in popularity among the country’s heads of state, kindling nostalgia like a popular old record – a corollary to people’s frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myung-bak.
Park, who lost her first bid for the GNP’s nomination to Lee in 2007, needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 2012.
An astute politician, Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around – a move that, as part of long-term political strategy, made perfect sense.
To many South Koreans, the election is now Park’s to lose.
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her.
If she wins, it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity, not her political heritage.
No one in South Korea’s conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them. And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status.
Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron.
Indeed, she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher – a lady not for turning, in Thatcher’s famous phrase, and with clearly thought-through political principles animating her actions.
In any case, she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge ‘jul pu se,’ literally meaning ‘reduce-loosen-strengthen tax-cuts,’ deregulation, and law and order, not just to add another chapter to her father’s old book.
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country’s troubled recent past.
Left-leaning pundits claim that the dictator’s daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father, though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures, and cut her political teeth in the tough-minded politics of the GNP.
Others take a flagrantly sexist stance, arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security.
Although these criticisms don’t seem to bother the electorate very much, Park’s path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect.
She has been called the “Queen of Elections,” in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man. But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea’s most serious problems, including high unemployment, worsening educational performance, and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years, while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy.
She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles.
Come presidential election-day in 2012, South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue.
Park’s success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines.
Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori’s daughter, who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month, Park is likely to defy her family’s tragic history.
If she does, she will be Asia’s most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year.
PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age.
On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice.
October 24 is 350 Day.
The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world’s leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change.
It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year.
The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming – denounced as “alarmist” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative.
We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do.
The melting of arctic ice is one example.
Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary “Northeast Passage” across the north of Europe and Russia to China.
They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest.
This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage.
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays.
An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice.  In other words, our greenhouse gas emissions have, by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice, created a feedback loop that will generate more warming, and melt more ice, even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow.
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.
In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called “permafrost” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen.
But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane.
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.
At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that, while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its greatest impact will probably be on Africa, which has few resources to cope with the challenge.
Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs.
The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid, but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our waste gases.
Sri Lanka took a similar stance, using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008, environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person.
In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit.
But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it.
As Sri Lanka’s government pointed out, “That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent.”
This situation is an injustice of vast proportions, reminiscent of – and arguably much worse than – the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century.
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.
Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as “strong action” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm.
In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps.
On October 24, people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2.
There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change.
Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted.
Atwww.350.org you can find out what is happening near you and join in, or put your own idea online.
But don’t just sit back and hope that others will do enough to make an impact.
One day your grandchildren will ask you: what did you do to meet the greatest moral challenge of your time?
Cambridge – It may take a few months or a couple of years, but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today’s crisis.
The world economy, however, is unlikely to look the same.
Even with the worst of the crisis over, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world, one in which international trade grows at a slower pace, there is less external finance, and rich countries’ appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished.
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
Not necesarily.
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants.
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing.
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms.
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products. 
The first two models are at greater risk than the third.
But we should not lose sleep over them, because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable.
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group.
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today’s new realities.
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end.
Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy.
The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services, such as housing and construction.
Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts, for similar reasons.  Commodity prices tend to move in cycles.
When they are high, they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other, non-traditional tradables.
Moreover, commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions, leading to costly struggles for resource rents, which are rarely invested wisely.
So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady, long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured and other “modern” goods.
By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products, these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities.
Their governments pursued not just good “fundamentals” (e.g., macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation), but also what might be called “productivist” policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls.
China exemplified this approach.
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods.
In recent years, China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US – the counterpart of its undervalued currency.
But it wasn’t just China.
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows, because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies.
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future.
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services.
In the past, this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits.
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries.
So, are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other?
Will developing countries’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world’s intolerance of trade imbalances?
There is in fact no inherent conflict, once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses, nor even the volume of their exports.
What matters is their output of modern industrial goods (and services), which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously.
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus.
By encouraging industrial production directly, it is possible to have the upside without the downside.
There are many ways that this can be done, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure.
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument.
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances.
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood.
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate.
Another is that external policy actors (for example, the World Trade Organization) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate.
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances.
George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially with the military response to terrorism.
American foreign policy reflects that obsession.
This year, the US will spend around $450 billion for the military, including the costs of the Iraq War, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases.
In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment.
Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession.
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, and took up almost the entire UN agenda.
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia.
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy.
Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues, and emphasizing the military response to it, will not bring prosperity and peace, or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks.
While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria.
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive, failing approach of America's government.
President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change.
Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word.
He declared in London recently that "the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required."
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges.
For example, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, America signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7% of national income.
That would bring an additional $60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year.
Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled.
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992.
It has so far failed to act.
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
Yet at Cancun, Mexico earlier this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies.
The list goes on and on.
At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty, yet it has taken few steps in that direction.
At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protect global ecosystems, yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then.
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN.
But because the US is the richest, most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating.
If the US really wants to undercut terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere.
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses.
The US represents just 5% of the world's population, and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly.
Poor countries, especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines--should say, "We need to act on the issues that concern us, not just on the issues that concern the US."
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness.
Turkey's seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey's conflict between its "strategic alliance" with America and its drive to join the EU.
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU.
Some liberal elements of that "secular" coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament.
After coming to power, the AKP's leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as "conservative democrats," energetically engaged with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq, from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey.
Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey's "secular" state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board, the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West.
The US, preoccupied with the supposed specter of a "clash of civilizations" between Islam and the West, saw the AKP's modern, westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey.
Today, both "conservative democrats" and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU, while opponents include extreme nationalists, of both left and right, as well as some elements of the "secular" establishment.
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December's summit of EU leaders.
Instead, the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again, putting off formal negotiations that, in any case, may take years to complete.
Europe's persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary.
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military's domestic political role.
The paradox is that, by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey's options, Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey's status as a military outpost of the US.
At least, that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq.
Then, despite massive US pressure, Turkey's parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory.
Turkey's refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war.
The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort no current EU member could have contemplated.
Parliament's rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate.
Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government's true "Islamic" character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully "secularist"--voted against the plan.
Likewise, other elements of Turkey's secular establishment, including the President and the military leadership, either opposed or were lukewarm, at best, to the idea of war in Iraq.
Turkey's military initially remained silent on the issue, uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold.
By contrast, the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus.
Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives: either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state, or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship.
They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament, which, in voting down the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war.
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops.
In fact, the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US, consult with the Turkish military and President, and share all information with the public and parliament.
Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation, the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament.
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally.
After the US military action in Iraq, the tables may be turning in surprising ways.
As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military significance may decline.
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey's symbolic importance as a role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform.
With careful management, Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe, while rebuilding its relationship with America.
COPENHAGEN – Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change, many countries – including Brazil, Australia, the United States, and the members of the European Union – passed laws in the 2000’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs.
The intention was understandable: if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), we could save 3.5% of all electricity, or 1% of our CO2 emissions.
The current attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to roll back America’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion.
Many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers.
But it’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming.
Let’s be clear: we do need to tackle climate change.
But this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions.
Burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits, and we should weigh those benefits against the costs.
A tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage.
The best estimate of this is about $7/ton of CO2 or $0.06/gallon of gasoline (€0.015/liter).
Most developed countries already have a tax of this size (and often much larger) on electricity and fossil fuels, although this also incorporates the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity.
While CFLs are more expensive to buy, they are much cheaper over their lifespan, because they use much less energy (even more so with the cost of CO2 factored into taxes on electricity).
Thus, on a straightforward cost-benefit basis, it seems to make sense for most people to switch from incandescent bulbs to the new, greener technology.
This is what is great about technological solutions to climate change: if an alternative option is cheaper, people will start using it.
My household uses CFLs, and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO2 emissions and spending less money.
Why, then, is it even necessary to outlaw the old bulbs?
The reason is that monetary cost is only one factor.
Many people find it annoying that CFLs take time to “warm up.”
Or they believe that their light is “funny.”
Or they worry that the bulbs can spread poisonous mercury if they break.
For some people, energy-efficient bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines.
The up-front cost is a factor, too, especially for those on low budgets.
And in places where lights are not used very often, a lower-price incandescent bulb can cost less overall than the energy-efficient alternative.
You might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves.
But proponents of phasing out access to incandescent bulbs argue that they know better.
As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently, “We are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.”
Setting aside other possible objections to this view, there is the problem that it presumes that all incandescent bulbs are worth less than $7/ton of CO2.
This is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs, or for those who are seriously worried about mercury, or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs.
The solution should be to focus on improving the technology – making the lights safer, brighter, warm up faster, and save more energy, so that more people will replace more of their lights.
But it is not just light bulbs that policymakers have tried to ban.
EU parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to outlaw patio heaters, which one MEP declared to be “a luxury the planet cannot afford.”
Who decides when something is luxurious?
And where does this end?
Should we outlaw air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious?
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with fewer CO2 emissions?
It makes sense to reflect the cost of CO2 (among many other factors) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our patios; but when the phase-out proceeds more slowly than some lawmakers wish, a ban is not the right solution.
Real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior.
CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way, but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives.
This is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong.
Governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions, while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs.
Limiting access to the ‘wrong’ light bulbs or patio heaters, ultimately, is not the right path.
We will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options.
Then, people the world over will choose to use them.
TOKYO – 2009 was a good year for China.
The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession.
American President Barack Obama visited China, more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world’s greatest superpower.
Even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted: failure in its attempt to commit China, or any other industrial nation, to making significant cuts in carbon emissions, with the United States getting the blame.
The Chinese government, under the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident.
So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison, just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule?
Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition, Charter 08, signed by thousands of Chinese, calling for basic rights to be respected.
Liu is not a violent rebel.
His opinions, in articles published on the Internet, are entirely peaceful.
Yet he was jailed for “inciting subversion of state power.”
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd.
And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him, to prevent others from expressing similar views.
Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions, or even peaceful petitions, so dangerous?
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks.
Without legitimacy, no government can rule with any sense of confidence.
There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements.
Liberal democracy is only a recent invention.
Hereditary monarchy, often backed by divine authority, has worked in the past.
And some modern autocrats, such as Robert Mugabe, have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters.
China has changed a great deal in the last century, but it has remained the same in one respect: it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics.
Legitimacy is not based on the give and take, the necessary compromises, and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy.
Instead, the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief, imposed from above, in ideological orthodoxy.
In imperial China, this meant Confucian orthodoxy.
The ideal of the Confucian state is “harmony.”
If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs, including moral codes of behavior, conflicts will disappear.
The ruled, in this ideal system, will naturally obey their rulers, just as sons obey their fathers.
After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism.
Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals, because it was bookish, introduced a modern moral orthodoxy, and was based, like Confucianism, on a promise of perfect harmony.
Ultimately, in the Communist utopia, conflicts of interests would melt away.
Chairman Mao’s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism.
This orthodoxy, however, was also destined to fade away.
Few Chinese, even in the top ranks of the Communist Party, are convinced Marxists anymore.
This left an ideological vacuum, swiftly filled in the 1980’s by greed, cynicism, and corruption.
Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China, collectively known as “Tiananmen.”
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom.
Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen, a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism: Chinese nationalism.
Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation.
The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power.
To doubt this was not just mistaken, but unpatriotic, even “anti-Chinese.”
From this perspective, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views were indeed subversive.
They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy, and thus on the legitimacy of the state.
To wonder, as many have, why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 – or to find some accommodation with its critics today – is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics.
Negotiation, compromise, and accommodation are the marks of economic politics, where every deal has its price.
By contrast, those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate, for that would undermine the belief itself.
This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese – or, for that matter, that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West.
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics.
These things can change.
Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China.
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about.
Many non-Chinese, including me, have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo.
One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views.
But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
Until China is released from the grip of religious politics, Liu’s ideals are unlikely to take root.
This does not bode well for China, or, indeed, for the rest of the world.
As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq, fears that the country's economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion; with that, worries about the health of the global economy are growing, too.
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy's growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come.
Can the situation get worse?
Yes, it can: much worse.
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time:
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan's misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor.
Today, these deficits set new records by the month;
America's appallingly low savings rate.
When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed, this was understandable; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings, so why bother?
Today's savings rate, while it has increased slightly, still finds America at the bottom of the world's savings league tables;
lax accounting standards.
The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals didn't emerge out of thin air, but had their origins in the mid-1990s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters.
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today's excess capacity.
To this old brew, new ingredients have been added, notably the most rapid change in a nation's fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen.
In a "now you see it, now you don't" move only a magician should love, the $3 trillion, ten year (non social security) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gapingdeficit of $2 trillion dollars.
Of course, excuses are at hand: the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold.
Excuses, excuses.
As the old saying goes: Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens, it sold them forward!
To anyone with decent eyesight, it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense.
Clear, too, was the fact that, in promoting its tax cuts, the Bush Administration was engaging (on a multi-billion dollar scale) in dishonest, Enron-like accounting.
So if things are so bad now, how can they get worse?
Here's a plausible scenario.
To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day.
When America was the only safe haven for global investors, this was easy.
But America today appears less safe.
The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts, lack of confidence in America's economic policy management (compounded by the mounting deficits), and America's soft underlying economic fundamentals, has dented the US economy's global reputation.
As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect, the dollar will weaken.
As the dollar weakens, America looks even less safe.
So a rush to the door begins.
While a weak dollar may be good for exports, a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence.
Eventually, even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement, especially given Bush's proposed risky experiments with the social security system.
At that point, Americans will join the stampede out of their economy.
Why shouldn't they?
They're free to choose where to put their money.
Europe's stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative.
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe.
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports.
The European Central Bank, fixated on inflation, will be slow to lower interest rates, and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses.
Europe will join America in a downturn, reinforcing America's decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral.
I am not predicting that this will happen.
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy: a tax cut that might made minimal sense when itseemedthat the US had a multi-trillion dollar surplus no longer makes any sense at all.
The Bush Administration should admit this, and redesign a tax program to strengthen the economy by making the country live within its means.
President Bush could even stabilize the economy, offering better unemployment benefits to provide needed stimulus if the downturn continues.
America is strong, and the global economy is strong.
Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur, a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes.
Downturns, of course, can never be fully prevented. We can, however, decrease their frequency; we can make them shallower; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected.
Sadly, we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences.
Last winter, America's central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back.
The Fed's cut in its basic interest rate to 1.75% per year seemed to have worked: the recession was ending.
Despite sobered expectations about the high-tech revolution's impact on productivity and profits, as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center, American businesses, it was believed, would soon start investing again big-time because borrowing money at 1.75% was too good a deal to pass up.
By late spring, those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen.
Suddenly, everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies.
Suddenly, everyone saw just how much America's system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990s.
The American stock market fell 15-20% below its winter levels.
Spreads between the interest rate at which America's government could borrow and the interest rates at which America's corporations could borrow widened.
Suddenly, the Fed stopped congratulating itself: a 1.75% interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow-Jones stock market index stands at 10,000, but not when the Dow-Jones index stands at 8,500.
Throughout the summer, corporate investment news remained disappointing.
More and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a "double dip" recession.
Yet throughout all this, the Federal Reserve remained passive.
The short-term interest rates it controlled didn't budge.
Only in mid-August did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut.
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts.
First, short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only.
They would thus have little effect on the longer-term rates that really drive business investment.
Second, short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets: if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts, the argument went, businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them.
The Fed's judgment appeared to be that it was largely (if not completely) powerless: it had done all that it could, and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity.
So the US in 2002 joined Japan in what economists have for sixty-five years called a Liquidity Trap: a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession.
America's situation was not unique: Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mid-1990s. But there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain.
How long this state of affairs will last is unknown.
Nevertheless, even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap, and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon, this is a frightening situation.
If monetary policy is not effective, the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy: changes in the government's tax and spending plans to change the government's direct contribution to aggregate demand.
But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex, baroque, eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy.
It simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy.
An America caught in a liquidity trap is, quite simply, a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management.
There have been two eras since World War II when policymakers - American policymakers, at least - believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy.
The first was the Keynesian high-water mark of confidence in demand management of the 1960s. It was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oil-price shocks of the 1970s.
The second was the decade of successful business-cycle management by Alan Greenspan's independent, apolitical, and technocratic Fed during the 1990s.
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first.
Eighty years ago, John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-World War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was, and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated.
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle.
He would be shocked to look at today's world: a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment, a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation, and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news.
THE HAGUE – The war in Afghanistan, now approaching its tenth year, may seem to many to have no end in sight, but Latin America has endured an even longer fight, one that has recently become much more bloody: the “war” against drug trafficking.
So rote – and so violent – has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction.
The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of narco-trafficking-related murders – which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than 22,000 since late 2006 – is to build “stronger, more resilient communities.”
Ciudad Juárez, a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world, would have to be high on the list.
Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas.
Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza, the name given to any trafficking route, butcher each other and the security forces.
There is apparently no shortage of young, unemployed men willing to join the carnage.
Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez, however, is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles.
Mexican President Felipe Calderón has, in this respect, remained faithful to the script written in previous theaters in the drug war, whether in Bolivia, Colombia, or Peru, where governments have used military force and extradition to placate the US and punish those with the least voice and influence.
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics.
Three former Latin American presidents, Mexico’s second richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and the Supreme Court of Argentina, among others, have criticized the war on drugs as a manifest failure that has lowered street prices, fueled production, and undermined weak states.
More strikingly, both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs.
Bolivia’s Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country’s coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops, the so-called Dignity Plan.
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa’s father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old.
These leaders’ profound ambivalence toward the goal of a world free of illegal drugs is shared by the European Union, where restrictions on narcotics consumption have slackened over the past decade.
The past three US presidents, furthermore, have all admitted to consuming – to one extent or another – illegal psychoactive substances, while seven million Americans, according to the United Nations, are regular cocaine users.
But the inertia of a bureaucratic drug-enforcement superstructure (worth approximately $40 billion each in the US and the EU), sustained by a deep-seated fear of the “threat” posed by drugs and cartels, appears to push policy repeatedly towards the familiar option of repressive auto-pilot.
For example, US support for Mexico’s campaign against the cartels looks set in stone, with Congress apparently ready to provide $300 million for another year of military and security upgrading.
In Colombia, seven new joint military installations are planned, and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted.
Nevertheless, as the flaws in the four-decade-old edifice of counter-narcotics become more visible, it is increasingly difficult to regard the risks of drug use as being greater than the damage done by repression.
Prohibition hikes the mark-up on prices – an astounding 15,000% in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities.
While the war on drugs focuses on bringing down cartels and their kingpins, it perversely aids the health of their markets, which nestle within legitimate trade flows and respond to price incentives.
Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year, the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, made the point clearly: “The narco problem involves millions of people.
How do you control it?
The capos can be jailed, killed, or extradited, but their replacements are already wandering around.”
The emergence of Latin America’s powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals.
These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied, inconsistent, and bureaucratic war.
Indeed, the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counter-insurgency training provided in the 1990’s to a select group of special-forces soldiers, who later deserted.
The Zetas’ star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military’s special forces, whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken.
Meanwhile, in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America, drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor.
It is time for serious reconsideration of the status and regulation of illegal drugs, pointing to selective legalization, as well as reclassification of the market as a public-health, rather than a criminal, concern.
For now, policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious.
Brazil's successful return to the financial markets at the end of April and the strengthening of the country's currency, the real, have shown that the election of President Luiz Inácio da Silva (Lula) has not led to a collapse of foreign confidence.
But nor do recent positive developments eliminate the need for structural economic reforms.
Lula recognizes that progress in this area, including labor market reform, is critical if Brazil is to grow sufficiently to allow him to carry on his ambitious social agenda.
How Lula, a former metal worker and founder of CUT, which also represents most automobile workers, manages relations with the trade unions will be critical.
Recent strikes by car workers at General Motors, Renault, Volvo, and Ford factories in Brazil do not augur well.
Proposed social security and tax reforms, presented to Congress at the end of April, seem to be creating additional tension.
Lula should look to Europe for examples of how to achieve high rates of growth and job creation yet maintain social protection.
Europe also can provide a roadmap for politicians determined to move from being anti-market left-wingers in opposition to reform-minded statesmen holding power.
Spain's Felipe González and Britain's Tony Blair both made that journey.
But a better example may be Wim Kok, who stepped down last year after eight years as Dutch Prime Minister.
Both Lula and Kok share the unusual distinction of becoming heads of government after serving as trade union leaders.
Upon reaching the top of the FNV, Holland's largest trade union, Kok found himself in a position of considerable influence in Dutch economic policymaking.
During his tenure as a union leader in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Dutch economy experienced prolonged malaise--stagnant growth, high unemployment, prohibitive interest rates, and low corporate profitability.
Large fiscal deficits crowded out private investment.
Holland's problems were mainly structural, although a cyclical economic downturn made matters worse.
By 1982, the situation had deteriorated to the point that the "social partners" in the Dutch tripartite system (government, business, and trade unions) concluded that combating the crisis required a break with the past.
The defining moment came with the Wassenaar agreement of that year--a pact between employers and trade unions, reached with the active encouragement of government.
Trade unions agreed to moderate wage claims and abandon wage indexation, in exchange for reduced working time and improved prospects for the future.
The increased flexibility of the Dutch labor market eventually restored private-sector profitability and led to rapid job creation, among the highest in Europe and comparable to the rate in the US.
A prudent fiscal stance, pursued while the economy recovered and interest rates fell, created room for big cuts in taxes and social contributions.
With lower inflation, this raised workers' real disposable income, enabling trade union leaders to demonstrate to their members that wage moderation worked and was in their interest.
The recent, much weaker, performance of the Dutch economy is largely explained by strong wage increases, which undermined competitiveness and contributed to job extinction.
This prompted Kok to call last year--on the 20th anniversary of the Wassenaar accord--for a new pact among the country's social partners.
He will soon have a European-wide platform to deliver his message of wage moderation and labor-market flexibility through his assignment to breathe new life into the EU employment strategy.
How is the Wassenaar model relevant to Brazil?
Not unlike Holland in the early 1980s, Brazil's economy today faces the challenge of stimulating rapid employment growth amid fiscal constraints and high interest rates.
While Brazil's registered unemployment rate is not very high by regional standards, its fast growing labor force requires a high rate of job creation.
Emulating the Dutch experience with job creation provides the surest possible path to alleviating poverty in Brazil.
The idea is not that Brazil should seek to implement the Dutch social-economic model--the countries are too different for that.
But Lula can and should follow Kok's example and use his trade union connections, as well as his rapport with the working class, to achieve a social pact aimed at achieving sustained improvement in Brazil's overall economic performance and realizing its potential to become Latin America's economic powerhouse.
Brazil has benefited from an improvement in market sentiment and financial indicators since Lula's election.
Now its government should encourage a Wassenaar-style guarantee of social peace. This would give the authorities room to address the country's daunting longer-term policy agenda--including a major reform of the costly pension system, an overhaul of the tax system, and strengthening the bankruptcy framework--that Brazil must face in order to boost competitiveness.
Lula's countrymen, who elected him overwhelmingly, need rapid economic growth and job creation.
That will happen only if Lula completes a successful transformation from anti-market trade union leader into a statesman judiciously blending economic and social reform.
Success would benefit not only Brazil, but have a strong demonstration effect across Latin America.
MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure, the eurozone’s crisis-hit countries are, at long last, bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets. Salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level.
And yet, competitiveness in Greece and Portugal, in particular, is not improving.
The latest Eurostat figures on the evolution of the price index for self-produced goods (GDP deflator) show no tendency whatsoever in the crisis-stricken countries towards real devaluation.
But real devaluation, achieved by lowering prices vis-à-vis their eurozone competitors, is the only way to re-establish these countries’ competitiveness.
A reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions.
After all, it was price inflation in the crisis countries, fueled by massive inflows of cheap credit following the introduction of the euro, that resulted in their loss of competitiveness, ballooning current-account deficits, and accumulation of enormous foreign debt.
Now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits, prices should be going into reverse, but this, obviously, is not happening.
In 2010, inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors.
The latest Eurostat figures for the third quarter of 2011, however, are already showing a different picture: the price level in Portugal and Greece has remained practically unchanged over the course of the year, and in Italy and Spain it even rose slightly (by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively).
Only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation – as it has since the country’s real-estate bubble burst in 2006 – with a relative price decrease of 2.2%.
On the whole, Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of 15% over the course of the past five years.
This internal devaluation is paying off: while Ireland was still running a current-account deficit of 5.6% of GDP in 2008, the European Commission expects the outturn for 2011 to have been a 0.7%-of-GDP current-account surplus.
True, much of this is mere debt-service relief, given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with self-printed money, for which it pays only 1% interest.
However, Ireland’s big trade surplus did improve further.
Ireland owes much of this turnaround to its efficient export sector, whose supporters were able to enforce a political U-turn.
Greece, on the other hand, is under the influence of a strong import lobby.
As the Greek economics minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, has said, this is attributable to European Union subsidies, which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector.
Now these importers form a powerful bulwark against any policy that causes deflation, even though lowering prices – and thereby redirecting Greek demand from foreign to domestic products and helping tourism – is the only way to put the Greek economy back on its feet.
Since Greece’s current-account deficit as a share of GDP was three times higher than Ireland’s, Greek prices would have to fall by about half to achieve the same kind of success.
It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest, if not conditions approaching those of civil war.
But it isn’t just importers who are blocking real devaluation.
Unions, too, are resisting the necessary wage reductions, and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value, while their debts remain unchanged.
The situation is intractable.
Many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out.
This help has been given. The recent agreement gave Greece relief of €237 billion ($316 billion), about 30% more than Greece’s net national income of roughly €180 billion euros.But such help only entrenches the wrong prices – and thus the economy’s lack of competitiveness.
The debts will re-emerge like a tumor, growing year by year, while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries.
If that happened, the euro would eventually collapse.
Only a price reduction would create current-account surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts.
It is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth.
Those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts.
In other words, they should take a kind of euro sabbatical – a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff.
After the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down, the sun would come out again very quickly.
The creditor countries would have to shoulder big losses from write-downs, but they would still end up with more than they would have gotten had the crisis countries remained within the eurozone, because these countries’ new prosperity, gained by leaving, offers the only chance of recovering any assets at all.
Longtime members of the European Union now seem to doubt the Union’s future, but we in Ukraine look at the European Union with hope and admiration.
To join in the EU’s progress is the basic object of our foreign policy, for Ukraine has discovered that nationhood is not an end, but a beginning.
Indeed, European unity is indivisible: when one nation is ostracized, all are not free.
We Europeans are caught in an inescapable net, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Every aspect of our shared culture, if not the last century of shared suffering, confirms that for us.
Whatever affects one European directly, affects all indirectly.
Never again can we afford to live with the narrow notion of two Europes, of haves and have-nots, of insiders and outsiders.
Anyone who lives within the European continent cannot – indeed, must not – be considered a stranger to its Union.
Today’s great Pax Europa and today’s pan-European prosperity depend on this.
Of course, some people mutter that Ukraine is not Europe.
Let them come to Kyiv and speak to the people, young and old, factory worker, farmer’s wife, the lawyers and doctors and teachers who stood and stayed in the cold and snow for weeks on end last winter to defend their freedoms.
Are they not united with those who stood alongside General de Gaulle in the French Resistance?
Are they not one with those who died fighting for the Spanish Republic in the 1930’s, who liberated Budapest in 1956 and ended fascism in Spain and Portugal in the 1970’s?
Are they not animated by the same spirit as Poland’s Solidarity and the peaceful masses that created Prague’s Velvet Revolution in 1989?
That is the true European spirit, and no doubts can crush it.
To those who say that Ukraine is too backward for EU membership, I say: Let them, too, come to my country and see the mothers who stay late at night at work teaching their children to use their workplace computer.
Let them come to the language classes in every village and city where young people are readying themselves for Europe by learning French and German and English.Those who doubt Ukraine’s European vocation should understand that Europe is not a matter of hardware and superhighways; it is the unquenchable desire for freedom, prosperity, and solidarity.
I believe that our future is as promising as Europe’s past is proud, and that our destiny lies not as a forgotten borderland on a troubled region, but as a maker and shaper of Europe’s peace and Europe’s unity.
Self-determination no longer means isolation, because achieving national independence nowadays means only to return to the world scene with a new status.
New nations can build with their former occupiers the same kind of fruitful relationship that France established with Germany – a relationship founded on equality and mutual interests.
That is the type of relationship that my government seeks with Russia, and achieving it is how we can help extend the zone of Europe’s peace.
Of course, it is premature to do more than indicate the high regard with which we view the prospect of EU membership.
We know that our part in that great edifice will not be built overnight.
We know that the great works of European unification lay not in documents and declarations, but in innovative action designed to better the lives and insure the security of all Europeans.
Building a Ukraine worthy of EU membership will not be easy, cheap, or fast.
But, like the Union itself, it will be built and it will be done.
We know the challenge is great, but the prize is worth the struggle, and Europe should know that this is our goal.
Part of the work of renewing Ukraine is a creative battle to put an end to a nightmarish century during which fascism and communism – ideologies born in the heart of Europe – battled for mastery.
Only a few months ago, in cities throughout Ukraine, our children and our parents confronted armed troops, snarling dogs, and even death.
Only a few years ago, a young journalist, Georgi Gongadze, seeking to inform the public about our old regime’s corruption, was brutalized and beheaded by that regime’s thugs.
But our Orange Revolution last winter shows that Ukraine’s people prevailed.
So, despite today’s doubts and difficulties, I retain an abiding faith in Europe.
I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities and horrors of Ukraine’s history.
I refuse to accept the view that Ukraine is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of communism’s legacy that we can never see the bright daybreak of peace and true European unity.
When the EU’s citizens ponder Ukraine’s place in Europe, they should look both beyond and more closely at the face they see.
They should look beyond the ravaged wastelands that communism inflicted, beyond the poverty, and beyond the social divisions through which our discarded ex-leaders sought to prolong their misrule.
Instead, they should look closely at the face of our president, Viktor Yushchenko, ravaged by poison during last year’s election campaign, and recall the words of the great Frenchman André Malraux, for whom “the most beautiful faces are those that have been wounded.”
MAYNOOTH, IRELAND – As the Greek financial drama reaches its sorry dénouement, another crisis looms for the European project – this time in Germany, beginning with a case now before Germany’s Constitutional Court.
Away from the rarefied atmosphere of EU summits (which, so far, have been shaping the Union’s response to events in Greece), other institutional actors have been – and are – shaping the EU system.
In particular, courts have driven European integration forward as much as politicians have.
The powerful European Court of Justice (ECJ), in particular, has frequently been criticized for using European law to disguise an integrationist agenda.
Without the ECJ’s doctrines of “direct effect” and “primacy,” and without national courts that are willing to enforce these doctrines in their own jurisdictions, the EU most likely would not have attained the level of integration that it has.
National courts may consider the effects of European integration on their constitutional and democratic institutions, affirming or rejecting the integration that has already taken place, or setting limits to supranational arrangements that might further impinge on national sovereignty.
This is significant, because, in May 2010, a group of prominent German economists, led by Joachim Starbatty, commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU’s assistance to Greece and Europe’s new financial rescue fund violated Article 125, the EU treaty’s so-called “no bailout” clause.
The Court will begin hearing the case on July 5.
Germany’s Constitutional Court has been among the most prominent in declaring what it considers to be the appropriate limits to EU integration, consistent with the country’s Basic Law (constitution).
In a number of landmark judgments, the Court has expressed skepticism about any move toward a federal EU.
In 1993, when ruling on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the judges expressed clear reservations about the direction of the European integration process.
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EU-level democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences.
For the same reason, the competence to decide upon the further allocation of competences had to remain a prerogative of the German state and could not be transferred to the EU.
Crucially, the Court also asserted its authority to invalidate European laws if found by the judges to lack a basis in the European treaties.
In another landmark ruling in June 2009, the Court made Germany’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty conditional upon the passage of new legislation giving the Bundestag enhanced powers of scrutiny over European affairs.
The Court relied on the same constitutional doctrines and conceptions of sovereignty elaborated in its Maastricht judgment.
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU’s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is consistent with the Basic Law.
The risk that the judges could rule the ESM illegal played no small part in efforts made in recent months by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy to bind the EU to a revised and more intrusive economic governance framework, effected through an amendment to the existing treaties.
The debate on sovereignty in Germany and other EU member states has been re-ignited not just by the debt crisis, but also by a string of controversial rulings by the ECJ, most notably the Court’s interpretation of the freedoms of establishment and service delivery articulated in its Viking, Laval, and Ruffert decisions.
The discontent within Germany with the cumulative impact of these decisions has been expressed publicly by some of the country’s most trusted public representatives.
In September 2008, for example, former President Roman Herzog published a polemic entitled “Stop the ECJ!”
He accused the Luxembourg judges of grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the Constitutional Court to invalidate several controversial ECJ rulings.
Herzog’s broadside resonated across Europe, where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about “judicial activism” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ECJ and other EU institutions.
In many member states, the ECJ’s decisions have produced a backlash, especially on the left, with trade unions and social movements targeting the Court’s alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests.
Such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, and in Ireland during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
Indeed, the threat to the EU legal order does not lie solely with the German Constitutional Court.
In Ireland, an embattled austerity-driven coalition government might well have no choice but to hold a referendum on the European Stability Mechanism.
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM.
The Irish government has stated emphatically that any amendments to the Lisbon Treaty connected to eurozone reforms will not require a referendum.
Its reasoning seems to be that the proposed changes fall far short of what the Supreme Court’s case law demands, and that the ESM does not alter the EU’s essential scope or objectives.
If the Irish Supreme Court were to decide that the ESM requires popular consent, the EU would be faced with the prospect of yet another Irish referendum on Europe.
Thus, Ireland might yet play as significant a part as Germany in determining the future of any amendments to the EU constitutional order, with each country’s top court playing as important a role as politicians in shaping Europe’s future.
As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union's future institutions, now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading.
Or at least, to consider perhaps a quite different question: where would it be reasonable for the EU to move?
Communism's fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe.
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation.
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well.
Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence, and Yugoslavia's breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence, there is something tantalizing new in all this as well.
In the interwar years, the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical, artificial creations of the Great Powers.
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states.
Why was this?
Because 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace.
To be viable, a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market.
None of this holds true today.
With the prospect of entry into the EU, national markets matter less.
Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable, and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members.
Lacking such external threats, the ties between, say, Czechs and Slovaks (to say nothing of Serbs and Croats!) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government.
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years.
After all, wasn't Italy, until 1860s, a collection of kingdoms and principalities?
Wasn't Germany's unification a matter of ``blood and iron''?
France and Spain are older, but is the marriage of Basques, Catalans, and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech/Slovak marriage?
Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English?
Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity, patriotism, the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and think of this: why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government, between the common European framework and their local institutions?
Why do Piemontese, Bavarians, or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies, welfare programs, securities laws, and the largely useless, duplicative armies?
Wouldn't life be easier if a common market, currency, foreign policy, army, and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis, with the rest left to more meaningful local units?
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation.
But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees, billions wasted in political patronage, and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40% of the economic product of Europe's nation states.
Could any common European state do worse?
Indeed, the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and society as a whole) in Europe's entire history.
Look at America in 1787: creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies, ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent.
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states.
It is only as anadditional level of government that the EU appears onerous and bureaucratic.
If it were todisplace national governments, its burden would be weightless in comparison to what exists today.
Nations also put Europe's constitutional balance out of kilter.
Germany and Italy are simply too big, as compared to Portugal or Belgium (itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons), and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire.
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in ``Europe'' as they feel in their national states?
No, but must they?
When Europeans think of future institutions, the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity.
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions, but by adevolution of loyalties, and a revival of smaller, more meaningful, communities?
Of course, the demise of national states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens.
Indeed, national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions, clichés, like race, class, and other ideological creations.
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle.
But Europe's nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they arecenters of power.
After all, forty cents out of every euro of GDP is a lot to fight about.
If, however, Europeans gain a sense of where they should be going, perhaps in time the national identities forged in the last couple of hundred years (for they are not much older than that) will become like the appendix - a part of the human body responsible for little else but an occasional inflammation.
PARIS – Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change?
In economic-development circles, experience and common sense suggest that progress, accountability, and hard work start with and depend on women.
Micro-credits, for example, are much more efficient when women receive and repay them.
Perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them, women are now perceived as the best and most determined “agents of change.”
That seems to be as true now of European politics as it has been of economics in parts of Africa and Asia.
The results of Italy’s recent municipal elections could be a signal of an incipient electoral dynamic: it was women who voted Silvio Berlusconi’s party out of power in Milan, a city that he has long controlled (and the original seat of his power).
No direct link exists between that result and the dramatic Dominique Strauss-Kahn scandal in New York, but in the immediate aftermath of DSK’s arrest, Italian women and young voters decisively mobilized to defeat Berlusconi’s party (led in Milan, ironically, by a woman).
These voters could no longer stand the combination of machismo and vulgarity that had once served so well the man Italian humorists now call “Berlus-Kahn.”
When Berlusconi first came to power 17 years ago, he had the support of a majority of women.
They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception of them (by turns celebrating their traditional domesticity and glorifying their sexual objectification). But Italian society has changed: most women are now working, and they are no longer willing to accept Belusconi’s anachronistic and outrageous chauvinism.
Italian men may pity the aging, isolated leader, who looks increasingly like his wax effigy at Madame Tussaud’s. But Italian women (indeed, women everywhere, it seems) feel only anger and humiliation over a man so obsessed with himself, his various criminal trials, and his vulgar pleasures that he appears to them to have no purpose left except to remain in power as long as possible.
Women, of course, are not alone in their opposition to Berlusconi, but they made the difference in Milan.
They are the incarnation of modernity, animated by a yearning for simple dignity and respect.
They are not alone in the vanguard of a new Europe of women.
As Iceland spiraled into bankruptcy, owing the irresponsible behavior of its mostly male political and financial elites, the people of Iceland decided that only a strong and responsible woman could redress the country’s problems. So they elected one as President.
The depth and gravity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain present women with a new opportunity.
Confronted with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of an “economic war,” women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families’ financial security. And the more widespread this becomes, the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic clout.
Of course, women’s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence. And the rest of Europe might never follow the example of Scandinavia, where gender equality has advanced much further than anywhere else.
But such a dynamic does now seem to be in motion.
Similarly, regardless of the outcome of DSK’s trial in New York, the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe.
Public and private displays of atavistic machismo, one hopes, will no longer be considered acceptable.
In the Arab world, too, from Tunis to Cairo, young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process.
Their appetite for change – understandable, given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies – appears to be one of the main causes underlying the force of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt.
None of this is to argue that “women” are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world.
Consider, for example, Marine Le Pen, the new head of France’s National Front, Elena Ceaucescu, the sordid wife of the former Romanian dictator, or, more recently, Tunisian ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s wife, Leila Trabelsi, who fled to Dubai with 1.5 tons of gold plundered from the central bank.
The point, simply, is that with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching change, the politics of gender is very much in play – in Europe and beyond.
The main question is whether the growing number of women in politics will deliver the different perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters (or protesters) now seem to crave.
VIENNA – European politics is mostly shaped by events and anniversaries.
But while events are often unforeseeable, anniversaries are not.
Five years from now, Europe will be reflecting on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, which led to a loss of life almost without parallel and set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of Europe as we now know it.
World leaders may have already reserved some days in August 2014 to mark the occasion.
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe’s savage twentieth century.
But how will Sarajevo look in five years?
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens view the future bleakly and whose politicians have totally lost touch with the electorate?
Or is there a hope that European leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful integration of the remaining Balkan countries into the European Union?
ABalkan Monitor survey recently conducted by Gallup Europe gives suggests the state of public opinion in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo 20 years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall and a decade after the end of the Kosovo war.
The findings seem to indicate that the next five years will be a make-or-break period for the region’s future development.
While the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that further armed conflict in the region is unlikely, the public’s mood – with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians – is pessimistic.
The future promises peace without development.
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions has been steadily declining.
The majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year, and there remains a perception that people have more opportunities outside their own countries.
Pessimism about employment is alarmingly high among young people, while corruption and government mismanagement are regarded as being widespread.
All those who have made it their job to praise the stability in the region should look at these figures.
Indeed, it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU.
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the surveyed countries are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction.
Less than one in 10 Croats (whose country could be joining the EU in the near future) believes that their country is heading in the right direction.
There are now two options for the region: one is a “shock integration” program that takes all of the Western Balkan states into the EU; the other is a journey into the unknown.
The hope that these countries can muddle through on their own is a dangerous illusion.
Stability alone can no longer be the EU’s only objective in the region.
The EU’s continuing presence as a colonial power in places like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo could cause even more problems in the future, especially if benefits are not forthcoming.
In particular, a delay in Serbia’s integration into the EU could bring Tito-inspired fantasies to the heart of the country’s foreign and security policy.
Thus, demoralization of Balkan society creates a dynamic of its own when the best and the brightest see their future outside of their own countries and where “stability” is just another name for political and economic stagnation.
If European leaders do plan to meet in 2014 in Sarajevo, they should act now.
The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU.
Today, unlike a year ago, we know how many states are in the Balkans, and theBalkan Monitor results show that all of them want to join the Union.
What the EU has learned from the results of the last parliamentary elections in Bulgaria is that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the leverage of Brussels over new member states increases rather than diminishes after they join.
The EU’s decision to liberalize its visa regime for Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia – and the fact that George Papandreou, the major architect of the EU’s Balkan integration strategy, is back in power in Greece – is another source of optimism.
But it is now or never for the Balkans.
Visa liberalization can be a strategic step in the direction of “shock integration,” but if it is not followed by bold political action from the EU, it could merely become a re-packaging of thestatus quo.
In short, the moment has arrived for shaping events instead of simply marking anniversaries.
BERLIN – The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun.
But, while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic, there is no guarantee of a successful political transition: democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes’ fall – not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young.
This will be impossible without external support.
Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean’s southern rim, Europe must not miss this opportunity.
So far, the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections, establish political parties, and reform the police, courts, and local administrations.
But such political-administrative support is not enough. Nor is a Marshall Plan-type program of grand investments sufficient.
This is not to discount the need for such projects; the renewable-energy sector, in particular, holds enormous opportunities for cooperation.
Europe needs clean energy, and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory.
The countries of North Africa also need energy – particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development.
Indeed, the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between, say, a shoemaker’s workshop and a shoe factory.
And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production.
According to some optimistic studies, solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there, but also provide more than 15% of Europe’s electricity by 2050.
Obviously, cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged.
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term.
They do not address today’s social or economic problems, nor do they signal a new society-oriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors.
New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia, Egypt, and others, and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean.
Catherine Ashton, the EU’s vice-president and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which contains a host of useful measures, including facilitation of visas for students, academics, and business people.
But, to make this scheme more concrete, I would suggest augmenting it with a “pact for labor and skills” between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation.
Europe, while afraid of illegal migration, needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons – not least young engineers, technical staff, doctors, and health-care workers.
Tunisia, Egypt, and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs, who often also need to acquire practical skills.
This is most urgent for the Arab world’s baby boomers – those between 20 and 35.
The next generation is already smaller.
As a practical step, the EU and its member states should offer 30,000 visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries.
Such a program would include, first, a traineeship in European firms, followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for 5-8 years.
At the end of that period, participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin.
Designed for at least a 15-year period, such a program would be a strong signal in itself.
It would show young people from Tunisia, Egypt, and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa.
It would be a real incentive to finish one’s university education (indeed, it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools, technical high-schools, and universities in North Africa and the Middle East).
Once implemented, the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe – and Europe’s image in the Southern Mediterranean.
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies.
And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries – improving professional skills, reducing the pressure on the local labor market, creating businesses and jobs – as well as in Europe.
Some warn against any programs for “temporary” or “circular” migration.
To be sure, some who benefit would want to stay.
But, while this “burden” might, in fact, benefit aging European countries, the risk is relatively low in the first place: Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes.
If they become consolidated democracies, as hoped, would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption.
And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one’s fortune back home.
Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia, Egypt, and other Arab countries.
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants.
At long last, these countries’ demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs.
NEW HAVEN – The global economy is in the midst of its second growth scare in less than two years.
Get used to it.
In a post-crisis world, these are the footprints of a failed recovery.
The reason is simple.
The typical business cycle has a natural cushioning mechanism that wards off unexpected blows.
The deeper the downturn, the more powerful the snapback, and the greater the cumulative forces of self-sustaining revival.
Vigorous V-shaped rebounds have a built-in resilience that allows them to shrug off shocks relatively easily.
But a post-crisis recovery is a very different animal.
As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time is Different, over the long sweep of history, post-crisis recoveries in output and employment tend to be decidedly subpar.
Such weak recoveries, by definition, lack the cushion of V-shaped rebounds. Consequently, external shocks quickly expose their vulnerability.
If the shocks are sharp enough – and if they hit a weakened global economy that is approaching its “stall speed” of around 3% annual growth – the relapse could turn into the dreaded double-dip recession.
That is the risk today.
There can be no mistaking the decidedly subpar character of the current global recovery.
Superficially, the numbers look strong: world GDP rebounded by 5.1% in 2010, and is expected to rise another 4.3% in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund.
But because these gains follow the massive contraction that occurred during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, they are a far cry from the trajectory of a classic V-shaped recovery.
Indeed, if the IMF’s latest forecast proves correct, global GDP at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its longer-term 3.7% annual-growth path.
Even if the global economy holds at a 4.3% cruise speed – a big “if,” in my view – it will remain below its trend-line potential for over eight years in a row, through 2015.
This protracted “global output gap” underscores the absence of a cushion in today’s world economy, as well as its heightened sensitivity to shocks.
And there have certainly been numerous such blows in recent months – from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and Japan’s natural disasters to sharply higher oil prices and another setback in the US housing recovery.
While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to have derailed the current global recovery, the combined effect is worrisome, especially in a still-weakened post-crisis world.
Most pundits dismiss the possibility of a double-dip recession.
Labeling the current slowdown a temporary “soft patch,” they pin their optimism on the inevitable rebound that follows any shock.
For example, a boost is expected from Japan’s reconstruction and supply-chain resumption.
Another assist may come from America’s recent move to tap its strategic petroleum reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower.
But in the aftermath of the worst crisis and recession of modern times – when shocks can push an already weakened global economy to its tipping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario – the escape velocity of self-sustaining recovery is much harder to achieve.
The soft patch may be closer to a quagmire.
This conclusion should not be lost on high-flying emerging-market economies, especially in Asia – currently the world’s fastest-growing region and the leader of what many now call a two-speed world.
Yet with exports still close to a record 45% of pan-regional GDP, Asia can hardly afford to take external shocks lightly – especially if they hit an already weakened baseline growth trajectory in the post-crisis developed world.
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this very risk.
Policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth scares.
They continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting post-crisis healing.
That is certainly true of the United States.
While the US Federal Reserve Board’s first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a wrenching crisis, the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy.
America’s zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets, and US workers need to align new skills with new jobs.
Open-ended liquidity injections accomplish neither.
European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset.
Mistaking a solvency problem for a liquidity shortfall, Europe has become hooked on the drip feed of bailouts.
However, this works only if countries like Greece grow their way out of a debt trap or abrogate their deeply entrenched social contracts.
The odds on either are exceedingly poor.
The likelihood of recurring growth scares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policies.
Driven by short-term electoral horizons, policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix – another bailout or one more liquidity injection.
Yet, in the aftermath of a balance-sheet recession in the US, and in the midst of a debt trap in Europe, that approach is doomed to failure.
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose – to buy time.
Yet time is not the answer for economies desperately in need of the structural repairs of fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, labor-market reforms, or improved competitiveness.
Nor does time cushion anemic post-crisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock.
It’s hard to know when the next shock will hit, or what form it will take; otherwise, it wouldn’t be a shock.
But, as night follows day, such a disruption is inevitable.
With policymakers reluctant to focus on the imperatives of structural healing, the result will be yet another growth scare – or worse.
A failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today’s post-crisis world.
WINDHOEK – Namibia is a resource-based economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program.
Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledge-based, diversified economy by 2030.
One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of “partnerships” – a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic, efficient, and sustainable development.
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources.
But such partnerships can’t be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict.
Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resource-rich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries, seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements.
From the perspective of companies, partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations.
By contrast, partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable, mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects.
This requires a framework that takes into account, among other things, developmental possibilities, environmental concerns, labor conditions, and community interests, and that is adaptable to changing circumstances.
For governments, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable long-term revenues.
For developing countries, this source of income can be substantial over several decades, and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure, health care, education, etc.
On the other hand, poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full long-term benefits of their natural resources, but also help to entrench poverty, corruption, and even conflict, particularly when governance systems are inadequate.
For companies, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capital-intensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings.
Companies also want, of course, contracts that won’t be repudiated by the next government.
Indeed, poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes, such as reduced security of mining titles, increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests, and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions.
Many governments in Africa simply don’t have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of in-depth knowledge of law, finance, geology, economic modeling, etc., while firms typically do.
As a result, the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above – to the disadvantage not only of governments, but also of firms interested in durable contracts.
In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations, governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair – thus dooming them to be breached at some point.
In these circumstances, there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances.
The outcome of such negotiations can be expected to be – and to be perceived to be – more balanced, more transparent, more stable, and therefore more sustainable.
The time has come to establish such a facility – in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors.
Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway.
At the same time, the Commission’s latest report on Turkey’s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down, further calling into question the country’s future EU membership.
The Commission’s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month. At that meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?
Has the EU’s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey?
What are the EU’s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey?
If the answers to the first two questions are “no” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important.
True, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and this is a violation of agreements. But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership.
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004.
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part.
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it.
Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part.
This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict. It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey.
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU’s fairness?
Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching, for they have clearly been spurred by Turks’ wish to move closer to the EU.
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.
This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction, towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state.
Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey’s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU’s behavior.
This leaves us with the third question: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU’s interest to see Turkey’s democracy and economy continue to strengthen.
More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership, it will be welcome in the EU.
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously.
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership.
But they are reacting to the current situation.
When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner – a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria (democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, and an effective market economy) – many more are inclined to say yes.
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.
First, they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans.
Second, they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations.
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors.
Here the Finns, who chair the EU right now, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict.
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.
At the same time, a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN’s proposals regarding Cyprus.
If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it.
The agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come: how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases?
The G8 leaders agreed to seek “substantial” cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give “serious consideration” to the goal of halving such emissions by 2050 – an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets, least of all the United States, whose president, George W. Bush, will no longer be in office in 2009, when the tough decisions have to be made.
One could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all.
At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 189 countries, including the US, China, India, and all the European nations, signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases “at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”
Fifteen years later, no country has done that.
US per capita greenhouse gas emissions, already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office, have continued to rise.
In March, a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade.
Now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago.
That’s a triumph?
If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails, that will be easy enough.
In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits.
Now, in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change, Ma Kai, the head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets.
Likewise, the spokesman of India’s foreign minister, Navtej Sarna, has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions.
Are China and India being unreasonable?
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century.
That is true: most of those gases are still in the atmosphere, and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is.
China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did, unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions.
China, India, and other developing nations, have a point – or rather, three points.
First, if we apply the principle “You broke it, you fix it,” then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our “broken” atmosphere, which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world’s climate changing.
Second, even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem, it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese, and as much as 18 times more than the average Indian.
Third, the richer nations are better able than less well-off nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations.
But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases, they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations.
This year or next, China will overtake the US as the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – on a national, rather than a per capita basis, of course.
In 25 years, according to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China’s emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan combined.
But there is a solution that is both fair and practical:
Establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth’s average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous. Divide that total by the world’s population, thus calculating what each person’s share of the total is.
Allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country’s population, multiplied by the per person share.
Finally, allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota. The fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny.
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth’s atmosphere?
But, in addition to being fair, this scheme also has practical benefits.
It would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas, because if they can keep their per capita emissions low, they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations.
The rich countries will benefit, too, because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations.
In recent days, Italy’s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country’s troop deployment in Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq.
Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy.
They are increasingly convinced that “victory” will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states, however powerful, and religiously driven armed insurgents.
Donald Rumsfeld’s dogma of military “transformation” – the technological upgrading of an army’s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed resoundingly in Iraq.
Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon.
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower.
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980’s nor NATO’s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield.
When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory.
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz’s notion of “decisive battles” as the “center of gravity” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “center of gravity.”
Indeed, while wars from the time of Hannibal’s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity, with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism.
Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war.
In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble.
Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever.
Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel’s border with Syria, India’s border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas.
In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict.
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence.Indeed, such asymmetric conflicts through proxies have become the new conventional way that states avoid the price of a general war.
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
“Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war.
Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict.
Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike.
And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before.
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.
It is during the war after the war that the occupier’s inferiority is revealed, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield.
The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with their enemies’ technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years.
The Iraq war and Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution.
When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity.
That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary.
But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today’s asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield.
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.
MOSCOW – Twenty-five years ago this month, I sat across from Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, Iceland to negotiate a deal that would have reduced, and could have ultimately eliminated by 2000, the fearsome arsenals of nuclear weapons held by the United States and the Soviet Union.
For all our differences, Reagan and I shared the strong conviction that civilized countries should not make such barbaric weapons the linchpin of their security.
Even though we failed to achieve our highest aspirations in Reykjavik, the summit was nonetheless, in the words of my former counterpart, “a major turning point in the quest for a safer and secure world.”
The next few years may well determine if our shared dream of ridding the world of nuclear weapons will ever be realized.
Critics present nuclear disarmament as unrealistic at best, and a risky utopian dream at worst.
They point to the Cold War’s “long peace” as proof that nuclear deterrence is the only means of staving off a major war.
As someone who has commanded these weapons, I strongly disagree.
Nuclear deterrence has always been a hard and brittle guarantor of peace.
By failing to propose a compelling plan for nuclear disarmament, the US, Russia, and the remaining nuclear powers are promoting through inaction a future in which nuclear weapons will inevitably be used.
That catastrophe must be forestalled.
As I, along with George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger, Sam Nunn, and others, pointed out five years ago, nuclear deterrence becomes less reliable and more risky as the number of nuclear-armed states increases.
Barring preemptive war (which has proven counterproductive) or effective sanctions (which have thus far proven insufficient), only sincere steps toward nuclear disarmament can furnish the mutual security needed to forge tough compromises on arms control and nonproliferation matters.
The trust and understanding built at Reykjavik paved the way for two historic treaties.
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty destroyed the feared quick-strike missiles then threatening Europe’s peace. And, in 1991, the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) cut the bloated US and Soviet nuclear arsenals by 80% over a decade.
But prospects for progress on arms control and nonproliferation are darkening in the absence of a credible push for nuclear disarmament.
I learned during those two long days in Reykjavik that disarmament talks could be as constructive as they are arduous.
By linking an array of interrelated matters, Reagan and I built the trust and understanding needed to moderate a nuclear-arms race of which we had lost control.
In retrospect, the Cold War’s end heralded the coming of a messier arrangement of global power and persuasion.
The nuclear powers should adhere to the requirements of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty and resume “good faith” negotiations for disarmament. This would augment the diplomatic and moral capital available to diplomats as they strive to restrain nuclear proliferation in a world where more countries than ever have the wherewithal to construct a nuclear bomb.
Only a serious program of universal nuclear disarmament can provide the reassurance and the credibility needed to build a global consensus that nuclear deterrence is a dead doctrine.
We can no longer afford, politically or financially, the discriminatory nature of the current system of nuclear “haves” and “have-nots.”
Reykjavik proved that boldness is rewarded.
Conditions were far from favorable for a disarmament deal in 1986.
Before I became Soviet leader in 1985, relations between the Cold War superpowers had hit rock bottom.
Reagan and I were nonetheless able to create a reservoir of constructive spirit through constant outreach and face-to-face interaction.
What seem to be lacking today are leaders with the boldness and vision to build the trust needed to reintroduce nuclear disarmament as the centerpiece of a peaceful global order.
Economic constraints and the Chernobyl disaster helped spur us to action.
Why has the Great Recession and the disastrous meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan not elicited a similar response today?
A first step would be for the US finally to ratify the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
President Barack Obama has endorsed this treaty as a vital instrument to discourage proliferation and avert nuclear war.
It’s time for Obama to make good on commitments he made in Prague in 2009, take up Reagan’s mantle as Great Communicator, and persuade the US Senate to formalize America’s adherence to the CTBT.
This would compel the remaining holdouts – China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan – to reconsider the CTBT as well. That would bring us closer to a global ban on nuclear tests in any environment – the atmosphere, undersea, in outer space, or underground.
A second necessary step is for the US and Russia to follow up on the New START agreement and begin deeper weapons cuts, especially tactical and reserve weapons, which serve no purpose, waste funds, and threaten security.
This step must be related to limits on missile defense, one of the key issues that undermined the Reykjavik summit.
A fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT), long stalled in multilateral talks in Geneva, and a successful second Nuclear Security Summit next year in Seoul, will help secure dangerous nuclear materials.
This will also require that the 2002 Global Partnership, dedicated to securing and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, chemical, and biological – is renewed and expanded when it convenes next year in the US.
Our world remains too militarized.
In today’s economic climate, nuclear weapons have become loathsome money pits.
If, as seems likely, economic troubles continue, the US, Russia, and other nuclear powers should seize the moment to launch multilateral arms reductions through new or existing channels such as the UN Conference on Disarmament.
These deliberations would yield greater security for less money.
But the buildup of conventional military forces – driven in large part by the enormous military might deployed globally by the US – must be addressed as well. As we engage in furthering our Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement, we should seriously consider reducing the burden of military budgets and forces globally.
US President John F. Kennedy once warned that “every man, woman, and child lives under a nuclear sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at any moment.”
For more than 50 years, humanity has warily eyed that lethal pendulum while statesmen debated how to mend its fraying cords. The example of Reykjavik should remind us that palliative measures are not enough.
Our efforts 25 years ago can be vindicated only when the Bomb ends up beside the slave trader’s manacles and the Great War’s mustard gas in the museum of bygone savagery.
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world.
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves.
Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned.
Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic.
Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people.
For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria.
Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies.
But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists.
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded "Revisionist" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion.
Then there are the strategic hawks.
For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations.
For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland.
They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one.
Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk.
For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?
Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes.
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an "Eastern front" against Israel has diminished.
Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day.
If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges.
First, he admitted that "eventually" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks.
A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of "liberated" rather than "occupied" territories.
Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the "relocation" of some settlements.
Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister.
Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers.
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign; Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy.
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme.
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal.
This year’s Cup, unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002, didn’t witness any real upsets in the first round.
Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round, and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat, with only Ghana advancing.
There have been just two ugly matches so far, full of fouls, nasty attacks, and unnecessary aggression, as well as numerous yellow and red cards: Italy vs. the US, and Portugal vs. the Netherlands.
Otherwise, we’re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany, in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere.
As for Germany and the Germans, one hardly recognizes one’s own country and people.
Even Mother Nature has played along.
After a long winter and a non-existent spring, summer started promptly with the first kick-off – and virtually overnight, Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side.
The weather is Mediterranean, and all of a sudden, so are the people.
The Cup’s organization has been exceptional (as was to be expected), with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance.
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world (which was not expected).
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer (which nobody could have expected!).
More importantly, not only in the German team, but also in the country as a whole, a young, cool, laid-back, and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan, friendly, and good-humored.
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.
Doctors are on strike, taxes are on the rise, the parties in government are mauling each other, and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape.
But the Germans, undaunted by it all, simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world.
The black, red, and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before, but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones.
In fact, the flags of many nations fly alongside German.
In Berlin, as in other large German cities, taxis sport the flags of their drivers’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia.
Fans don not just their nations’ flags, but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries’ colors.
Flags are flown in hope of victory, but also serve to dry the tears of defeat.
In short, Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night’s dream, with a touch of Woodstock to boot.
Outside the stadiums, public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “happenings.”
And how is the soccer?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone.
First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer.
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity.
Second, international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation.
Spain, Argentina, and Germany, to name but a few countries, have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game.
On the French, English, and Portuguese teams, too, it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane, Beckham, and Figo.
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002.
This generational change is accelerated by a third development.
At the top international level, soccer has become faster and more athletic, and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively.
A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 (or more) minutes, switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team, and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents' movements won’t stand much of a chance.
Here, soccer parallels today’s globalized markets, which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary.
Unlike economic globalization, however, it remains to be seen whether this new, fast-paced style of soccer will prevail (after all, the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France).
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does.
For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch.
Let’s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9, we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible.
Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism, because, unfortunately, two universal principles will continue to apply in the future: first, the winter will return, and, second, the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult.
Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991.
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq. ``Yes, I know,'' I said. ``I've been watching the bombardment on TV.''
Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq.
All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US, now Poland's NATO ally.
Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq's occupation.
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism's collapse in 1989!
Little of this, however, is the result of design, for (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union.
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us.
Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing'' we influence Europe's fate; others suffer crippling pessimism, consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class'' status--and you have a recipe for inertia.
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out.
Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset: we say that we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges.
Then we squabble about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO, membership in the Alliance didn't really require debate.
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was theonlyreal option.
EU membership and the global war on terror, however, demand a more deeply considered response.
Why?
Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy, and society, while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy.
Today's crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's ``New Europe,'' means that Poland (like every other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO.
We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests, as well what it really means to be an EU partner.
Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new'' and ``old'' Europe, as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds.
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
Instead, the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order.
They see new players (say, Spain) rising to shape EU policy, particularly foreign policy, and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged.
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades.
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse.''
Instead, the EU's structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe's role in the world, but also new means to achieve consensus.
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power.
The world needs a united continent, ready to go into action.
That consensus must include the US.
During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power.
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era.
Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic, and its belief that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won't spend the money necessary to achieve that goal.
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security.
The US is, but security does not come free of charge.''
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
Indeed, all of Europe is in thrall to American power.
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America.
If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear.
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
help poor countries.
Polish foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives.
They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations, in an expanded Union, and in relations between the ``New'' and ``Old'' Europe.
BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year: governments, he said, are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure.
Summers was criticizing Europe’s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU’s north and south, and between reckless banks’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day.
But, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel smug.
Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States, where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America’s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis.
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively, on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25% per year.
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two.
In that case, the $500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $1 trillion of extra output of goods and services, generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment, and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years.
And, with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs, the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future.
The impressive gains don’t stop there.
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $20 billion a year of income and social welfare.
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $20 billion a year in higher production.
And half of the extra $1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households.
In sum, on the benefits side of the equation: more jobs now, $500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and then a $40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter.
So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?
For starters, the $500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity.
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion.
The $40 billion a year of higher economic activity would, however, generate roughly $10 billion a year in additional tax revenue.
Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due, the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt.
In other words, taxpayers win, because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt, enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates.
Households win, too, because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes.
Companies win, because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure.
The unemployed win, because some of them get jobs.
And even bond investors win, because they get their money back, with the interest for which they contracted.
So what is not to like?
Nothing.
How, you might ask, can I say this? I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science, in which there are no free lunches, in which benefits are always balanced by costs, and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are.
But there are two things different about today.
First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole.
Second, bond investors are being really stupid.
In a world in which the S&amp;P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year.
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors’ extraordinary and irrational panic. They are willing to pay 6% per year for “safety.”
Right now, however, the US government can manufacture “safety” out of thin air merely by printing bonds.
The government, too, would then win by pocketing that 6% per year of value – though 30 years from now, bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy.
NEW YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort.
President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum, gas, and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges.
France, at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year, is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move.
With French leadership, 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear, precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities.
Oil, gas, and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies.
Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries.
Yet, despite great natural wealth, a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty.
The actual taxes and payments made by mining, oil, and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret, even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good.
In reality, in far too many countries, ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money; in fact, they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations.
Indeed, these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions. Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East.
In these countries, many of which are rich in oil and gas, citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression.
At bottom, they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world’s energy supplies.
Transparency is an essential part of the solution.
Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms, as well as mining companies, publish all of their relevant financial information, broken down by country and by project, and including all payments made to host-country public budgets.
If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges, this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located.
Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular, timely basis, and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies.
The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments, through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.
That law’s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90% of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies.
This will help citizens track how that money is used, but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share.
If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers, financial and accounting balances, and payments to authorities, companies would become truly accountable to citizens, and government revenues would be augmented.
Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission, and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance, integrity, and transparency in economic transactions.”
At its just-completed summit in Deauville, France, the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil, gas, and mining companies.
This is an important advance, but, unfortunately, it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative, and it focuses only on payments transparency.
Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed, given that important emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China, as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries, will be at the table.
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone.
Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives, economies, and political systems around the world.
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “a week is a long time in politics.”
So, in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election, any prediction made today could be reversed, and reversed again, before the vote. But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left.
In fact, they have more in common than meets the eye, for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity.
For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices.
The 12 years of Jacques Chirac‘s presidency, together with France’s tradition of alternation in power, suggests a victory for the left.
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today’s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate.
This is reflected in Sarkozy’s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high.
Sarkozy’s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America’s military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was disastrously wrong.
Thus, his deep admiration for “American values,” while sincere, implies no embrace of President George W. Bush.
It also reassures the French business community, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin’s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac’s foreign minister.
At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution.
The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, may have lost politically to de Gaulle, but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “false values.”
By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign.
In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible.
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic.
To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her “essence,” thereby countering Sarkozy’s stress on his record as a “doer.”
Her appeal to voters is simple: “I am a woman, and you have never tried a woman, so be modern and try one now.”
Hiding behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender, Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program.
When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”
Thus, Royal’s program is her popularity.
In foreign policy, one can only guess what her priorities would be.
As far as Europe is concerned, she seems as “agnostic” as Sarkozy, who, like her, incarnates a new generation of “post-European” leaders.
In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family.
According to public opinion polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy.
Her support is particularly strong among women voters.
For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal.
In the opinion of Royal’s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants, the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity: the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern.
According to Royal’s Socialist critics, the “Hollywoodization” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead.
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.
Moreover, both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac’s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture.
Royal openly claims Mitterand’s legacy as she searches for legitimacy, while Sarkozy’s rejection of Chirac’s legacy has more to do with form than substance.
To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less.
When the voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations, as it did in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round.
As in 2002, the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less. But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs.
Edmonton – Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10, making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there.
The trip is being carefully managed by both countries, and is being watched closely around the world, with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent, to say the least.
When Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, traveled to Japan ten years ago, bilateral relations were deteriorating: China was unhappy with the Japanese government’s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational.
The Japanese media’s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative, and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster.
Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002, almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan, and encouraged “New Thinking” in China’s Japan policy, which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties. But, instead of accepting China’s olive branch, Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine, which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan’s neighbors.
His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005.
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country’s long-term interests.
Koizumi’s successors, Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have sought to engage China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year.
Hu’s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen.
He will emphasize common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion, and promote further exchanges.
Japan is not only one of China’s largest trade and investment partners, it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms, partly to showcase that China’s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world.
Japan, whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years, is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity, as least in economic terms.
It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the father of today’s prime minister, signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China.
The two governments will certainly use Hu’s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship.
But, unlike three decades ago, when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries, public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones.
Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain.
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea.
Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection, areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries, the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters, which contain huge potential oil, gas, and other mineral deposits.
Even after many rounds of talks, no resolution is in sight, and Hu’s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs.
Then there are strategic suspicions.
Fukuda has dropped Abe’s talk about an “arch of freedom” – an effort to forge a bloc with the United States, Australia, and India. But Japan remains concerned about China’s rapidly modernizing military, while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits.
So, although both sides endorse the idea of a “mutually beneficial strategic relationship,” and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges, mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go.
Moreover, today’s “warm politics, cool economics” trend is the reverse of the “cold politics, warm economics” pattern under Koizumi.
Last year, Japan’s committed investment projects in China fell 24% from 2006, while actual investment volume decreased by 25%, partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment.
Recent food safety issues, such as the “poisoned dumplings” cases, have clearly heightened the Japanese public’s sensitivity about Chinese exports.
Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems.
While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month, an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni. And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II, another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China.
MILAN – By 2050, Brazil and Mexico will be among the world’s six leading economies, according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs.
Does the European Union care?
Is Latin America to be Europe’s next missed business opportunity?
Latin America has a population of 550 million, with average yearly per capita income of $4,000, immense natural resources, and substantial human capital.
It accounts for 8% of world production and grew by more than 5% in each of the past three years.
Although the United States remains the main destination of Latin American and Caribbean exports, Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources.
During the past four years, Latin America attracted an annual average of $61 billion in foreign direct investment, 60% of which went to Brazil and Mexico.
In the 1990’s, foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region, but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment.
Predictably, Spain is the most important European investor in the region, though several important Spanish operations have recently passed to Italian companies, among them the utility Endesa, acquired by Enel, which is now the biggest private energy distributor in Latin America.
Meanwhile, Latin American businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments.
In 2006, Brazil invested $28.2 billion abroad, compared to inflows of $18.8 billion.
Indeed, emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades.
In 2006, Italy’s Fiat Group and India’s Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India.
The following year, they extended their partnership to Latin America, investing $80 million in production of a Tata pick-up truck at Fiat’s factory in Cordoba, Argentina.
It is to be hoped that many more major European corporations will follow suit.
But small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) – the majority of firms in both Latin America and Europe – find it difficult to trade and invest at international level, in part because of high transaction and information costs.
In Europe, clusters of SMEs appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope, and thus to succeed collectively in global markets.
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America.
In Brazil, four local production systems have combined to form Project Promos/Sebrae/BID, based on the example of Italy’s industrial districts.
Between 2002 and 2006, Brazil’s SME support services and the Milan Chamber of Commerce created partnerships involving furniture, shoes, designer lingerie, and handicrafts from different regions of the country.
This approach may well be the shape of things to come.
But, while the EU’s association agreement with Mexico is 10 years old, it does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil.
This is partly because of the never-ending negotiation process with Mercosur, the troubled – and still incomplete – Latin American customs union.
The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of Latin America’s regional blocs: Mercosur, the Caribbean Community, the Central America Common Market, and the Andean Community.
The EU must urge its Latin American partners towards further integration.
Adopting a common “rule of origin” for their products would be an incentive to liberalize their international trade further, thus increasing it.
Full trade liberalization in Latin America, although difficult to achieve, must be made central to EU strategy, and would boost economic growth.
But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced, trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high. EU cooperation thus should be directed to lowering trade costs.
The crucial issue is market access.
Most Latin American countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to Europe, the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources.
After the establishment of the EU-Chile free-trade area, Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially.
But in the case of EU-Mexico trade liberalization, the growth of imports from the EU has exceeded the growth of exports to Europe, resulting in a widening Mexican trade deficit with the EU.
This is at odds with the EU’s proclamations since the 1999 Rio summit that Latin America is a vital political and economic partner.
A change in Europe’s approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created.
The European Commission understands this.
Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil, it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible.
In mid-2007, the Commission confirmed that it will revisit the EU’s dialogue with Mercosur, with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations.
But there is also keen awareness that the EU’s hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc.
If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies, European institutions must become more open to the region’s needs.
A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising, because of the “pull” it might have on other countries. But this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board.
Otherwise, Latin America may well prove to be Europe’s next missed business opportunity.
As Europe’s leaders gather in Portugal to put the finishing touches on the new, slimmed down, Reform Treaty, it might be helpful if they all pretended that the last 50 years of European integration had never taken place.
Let’s then imagine what Europe needs to do to confront its most pressing challenges, especially if it were able to do so without the political constraints of 50 years of EU deal-making and ramshackle institution-building.
On top of that, let us make a major leap of imagination and suppose that even though this scenario of the EU at “Year Zero” means we would not have a half-century of intra-European cooperation to draw on, the nations that today make up the EU would nevertheless be keen to adopt far-reaching joint policies.
Let’s suspend our disbelief, then, and try to imagine what Europe could and should be doing to tackle some of the most far-reaching and obstinate policy challenges that will determine whether the next 50 years are as constructive as the last.
Or, to put it another way, let’s look at our problems in the light of the EU’s existing mechanisms and its potential for creating far-reaching new policies, and then let’s ask ourselves why the EU isn’t realizing its own potential and delivering the goods.
Broadly, we see three areas in which Europe’s policymakers at both the national and EU levels can do better: global challenges where Europe could show greater leadership, the creation and strengthening of human capital within the EU and worldwide, and improvement in the effectiveness of the EU’s own political machinery.
Europe needs a clearer and more recognizable global agenda.
It needs to build substantially on its leadership on climate change by adopting much tougher EU goals, and then use its international economic and trade clout to champion new global emissions standards that scientific opinion can accept as meaningful.
On conflict and security issues, Europe should be advancing to a new phase in which it takes much clearer and unambiguous positions on issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Burma’s military regime.
The purpose must be to establish Europe as a forceful and fair-minded player on the world stage, rather than as a “broad church” in which different viewpoints co-exist.
The aim should be that “soft power” instruments like EU development aid and economic partnerships would be linked with a growing sense of political and security outreach to ensure Europe is a global player to be reckoned with.
That means, of course, that the EU should seek to widen its transatlantic thinking so that the EU and the United States cooperate more closely on defining – and thus protecting – their common interests in a world where together they account for little more than 10% of the total population.
These points are far from a blanket criticism of the EU’s efforts to create a common foreign and security policy.
But they are intended to underline what many people in Europe know very well, which is that the speed with which problems concerning international development and conflict are growing easily outpaces the EU’s policy responses so far.
Building more human capital in Europe and worldwide is a crucially important element in future EU activities.
Education is by far the most profitable investment Europe can make, so it should be launching its most ambitious strategy ever to create a new knowledge dynamic and employment inside the EU while helping to expand greatly education in the world’s poorest countries.
Europe also must at last grasp the nettle of immigration policy – something that has persistently eluded generations of political leaders.
Agreed EU-wide immigration rules are needed to reconcile shrinking Europe’s hunger for imported labor with widespread fears of cultural tensions and social unrest.
It won’t be easy to create a fairer and more multi-cultural Europe, but failure to address this problem openly will carry an even heavier price.
By much the same token, Europe’s governments should be making a determined new effort to strengthen Europeans’ sense of a shared history and common values.
A stronger European identity is the soundest basis for creating the more multi-cultural society that demographers regard as inevitable.
Meanwhile, doubts still surround the political and institutional machinery the EU will need to realize these and other ambitious goals.
Sighs of relief greeted EU leaders’ mid-year agreement on a Reform Treaty aimed at overhauling the Union’s decision-making mechanisms, but it is still uncertain whether the new pact will survive the ratification process in 27 countries.
We believe, though, that the increased use of qualified majority voting by member governments embodied in the new treaty should also be applied to the ratification process itself.
That way, if a small minority of EU governments prove unable to ratify the treaty, it would not be torpedoed the way that its predecessor, the Constitutional Treaty, was in 2005.
Coral reefs are the world's most biologically rich marine ecosystems, harboring some of the world's most beautiful organisms.
They provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide.
Reef-based activities (principally fishing and tourism) form the economic livelihood of millions more.
Clearly, the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous.
Yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing.
Wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places, and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk.
But there is some good news, too: we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs' ``resilience''-- their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem.
We must mediate the severity of global warming, while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs.
Historically, the principal agents of reef degradation have been over-fishing and pollution, not global warming.
In healthy ecosystems, when prey numbers decline, predators become malnourished, and their numbers decline, too, giving their prey a chance to recover.
But human predators are different.
When our prey numbers decline, their economic value tends to increase, so fishing intensifies.
This means that once predator species become depleted, fishing pressure shifts towards plant-eating fish species, leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs.
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs.
When coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones, diseases, and other disturbances, it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check, and allow coral populations to recover.
Without them, fast-growing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef, preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover.
Because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend, the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reef's biodiversity.
Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations' ability to recover, giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge.
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant.
The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant; the plant converts sunlight into energy, which it shares with the animal.
For reasons that are not yet fully understood, this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures.
The plant is expelled, and corals turn a brilliant white color.
If temperatures soon return to normal, the partnership can be restored.
But if corals remain ``bleached'' for too long, they die.
For many species of coral, this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location.
Interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios, this is disturbing news.
If coral bleaching thresholds remain steady, local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades.
Corals grow slowly, so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again.
Fortunately, there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve.
Most coral species have broad geographical distributions, and bleach at different temperatures depending on location.
Many species that bleach at 28o or 29o centigrade on Australia's Great Barrier Reef routinely tolerate temperatures of 34o or more in the Arabian Sea.
Unfortunately, we do not know how long it takes for such adaptation to occur.
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs.
The first is obvious: minimize global warming by, say, honoring the Kyoto Treaty's emissions targets.
Second, we must restore coral reefs' capacity to cope with environmental change--their resilience--by protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check, and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching.
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread.
Without fish, seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery.
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world--on coral reefs and elsewhere--has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries.
Many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones.
So there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of ``no-take zones''--areas in which fishing is prohibited altogether.
As fish populations in these no-take zones recover, they create ``spill-over'' effects, with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones.
More importantly, they provide a refuge for fish populations, a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse.
On coral reefs, these no-take zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community, and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings.
Scientific evidence indicates that, to be effective, 30-50% of available habitat should be set aside as no-take zones.
This figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs, the US and Australia, where current levels of protection are less than 5%.
Given the magnitude of the threat to the world's coral reefs, the international community's response has been frighteningly slow.
But there is some encouraging news: in June, Australia's government proposed a major increase in no-take areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 30%.
If adopted, this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit.
The future of tropical marine ecosystems, and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them, depend on it.
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the EU candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
The French president has accused them of being "childish" and "irresponsible" in voicing their pro-US stance on the Iraq issue, and warned that their position could be "dangerous," as the decision to let them into the EU has not yet been ratified.
Quite a salvo.
Then the French president assumed the role of kindergarten instructor vis-à-vis what he called "badly brought up" candidate countries, telling them that they were "ill-behaved" and that "they missed a great opportunity to shut up."
To anyone who remembers that 40 years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed Europe's door shut in the face of Britain's request to join the European community--the General thought the British too tied to the US to enter the European family--these remarks are worrying.
But put things in perspective: Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle; and Europe has moved far beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally written by France.
President Chirac's self-appointed role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously, even by those of us who know (and love) France.
Instead, his outburst is best explained as a sign of frustration over the fact that French influence in the EU is being diluted.
Like King Lear after he lost his kingdom, there is nothing France can do about its lost influence but rage impotently.
But this dispute within Europe goes deeper than the matter of France's lapsed primacy.
I have always been skeptical about the rhetoric of a "common" foreign policy for the EU.
How can you possibly expect a country such as, say, France to accept being voted down by its EU partners on vital foreign and security policy issues?
At best, Europe should hope for a "more common" foreign and security policy, even though this fails to answer Henry Kissinger's old question: If you want to speak to "Europe," whom do you call?
I have long worked to secure a "much more common" foreign policy within the EU.
Therefore I am worried by today's split within the EU as well as between some member countries and the US over Iraq.
When eight European leaders published their appeal to heal the growing transatlantic rift, they were accused of undermining European unity.
Nothing could be more incorrect.
They were only exposing the lack of unity that already existed.
It all began last autumn when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, desperate to hold on to power, made Iraq an issue in the German election campaign.
He played on Germany's well-known and respectable pacifist feelings.
But by declaring that he would not, under any circumstance, participate in military actions against Iraq, he undermined the efforts at the UN to put maximum pressure behind the demands that Iraq disarm.
Then France embraced Germany.
French ways in foreign policy are often murky and difficult to decipher, unless it is crystal clear where France regards its interests to lie.
Usually France likes to keep its options open.
But when the French and German governments celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Elysée Treaty last month, France seemed to paint herself into a corner by supporting the German view.
All this was done without consultations between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU.
It was a demonstration of the special relationship between France and Germany that has for so many years been the driving force in European integration.
The history of Franco-German reconciliation is impressive indeed.
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements that they reach between themselves as the lodestar for common policies.
This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an "alternative" to American leadership in security policy.
Enlargement of the EU with a number of Central and Eastern European countries will strengthen resistance to Franco-German initiatives in this direction.
The letter from the eight European leaders--and the later statement from the "Vilnius Ten" group of Central and Eastern European countries--demonstrated that France (and Germany) cannot dictate a European agenda that creates transatlantic rifts.
This has obviously caused frustrations. But it should not have been a surprise to anyone.
The split within the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq because the pressure on Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions was weakened.
Chirac and Schröder do not seem to grasp this.
So this has not been one of Europe's finest hours, especially not while the EU's institutional convention is discussing a text that calls for EU governments to "actively and unreservedly support the Union's common foreign policy."
The German acronym for the EU's "common foreign and security policy" is GASP.
That seems an entirely appropriate expression for what we have been witnessing.
GAZA – This was supposed to be my first year of medical school.
Instead, I am stuck here in Gaza, in my father’s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp, with few options and no way out.
After I finished high school last year, I decided to become a doctor.
Gaza cries out for bone specialists, but the training I need is available only abroad. 
When I won a place at a medical college in Germany, my parents were proud. I was excited to follow my older brother, who is already studying there.
In February, the German authorities granted me an entrance visa.
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe. But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out – not students.
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad.
For many of us, this is our only opportunity to continue our education.
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide.
The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures, like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery. 
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies.
Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few post-graduate programs.
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza.
Without the ability to go overseas, we cannot learn.
In June, after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “recognized” scholarships – but not “hundreds.”
So hundreds of us are still waiting, most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world’s attention.
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owns a children’s clothing shop. My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had been working as a teacher.
That was at the height of the peace process.
My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993, and decided that they could give us a better life here.
But when I was ten, the secondintifada began.
The peace process was collapsing throughout my teenage years.
During my third year of high school, the Israeli authorities closed off the Gaza Strip.
Israeli border controls have reduced the flow of people crossing the border to a trickle, and have suffocated Gaza’s economy, choking off imports and exports and cutting fuel deliveries and electricity.
There is no clothing left in my father’s shop, which was supposed to support my brother and me during our studies.
With the backing of the US, Canada, and the European Union, Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas, which won the elections here in 2006. But the blockade only makes people more desperate.
Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages.
But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip, including Jabalia.
Israel’s blockade amounts to collective punishment.
It is hurting all of us, whether we support Hamas or not.
It is also destroying my dream to write “Specialist in Bone Medicine” after my name.
Sometimes, I am sorry that I am from Gaza. But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills, and return to help others here.
Sometimes, when there is electricity, I watch television and see how people live in other places.
I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel, to study, to take vacations, when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine.
We are students, not soldiers.
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds?
Soon, my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes.
When they do, I will probably still be here in my father’s house, waiting for the blockade to end.
OXFORD – The top and the bottom of the list of countries in Newsweek’s recent cover story, “The 2011 Global Women’s Progress Report,” evoke images of two different worlds.
At the top of the list – the “Best Places to be a Woman” – we see the usual suspects: Iceland and the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada.
On that planet, we see rankings in the upper 90’s for the survey’s five categories: justice, health, education, economics, and politics.
Women are out-earning men in college degrees (United States), domestic abusers are being banned from their homes and tracked with electronic monitors (Turkey), and female prime ministers are being elected (Denmark and Australia).
Now look at the other planet, “The Worst Places in the World to be a Woman.”
In Chad, the worst of the worst, woman have “almost no legal rights,” and girls as young as ten are legally married off, which is also true in Niger, the seventh worst place for a woman.
Most women in Mali – the fifth worst – have been traumatized by female genital mutilation.
In Democratic Republic of Congo, 1,100 women are raped every day. In Yemen, you are free to beat your wife whenever you like.
Though it is stunning to see these two worlds in such stark and detailed relief, their existence is not news: development specialists and human rights groups have been calling attention to these inequities for years. But the systemic oppression of women tends to be cast in terms of claims for empathy: we shouldn’t follow these policies because they are not nice, not enlightened.
Some development researchers have started to make a compelling case, too, that oppression of women impedes countries’ efforts to escape poverty.
But the data in the Newsweek list show that we need to frame this issue in stronger, more sweeping terms: When poor countries choose to oppress their own women, they are to some extent choosing their own continued poverty.
Female oppression is a moral issue; but it also must be seen as a choice that countries make for short-term “cultural” comfort, at the expense of long-term economic and social progress.
It is not politically correct to attribute any share of very poor countries’ suffering to their own decisions. But it is condescending to refuse to hold many of them partly responsible for their own plight.
Obviously, the legacy of colonialism – widespread hunger, illiteracy, lack of property or legal recourse, and vulnerability to state violence – is a major factor in their current poverty. But how can we blame that legacy while turning a blind eye to a kind of colonialism against women in these same countries’ private homes and public institutions?
When the poorest countries – most of them in Africa or with Muslim majorities – choose to sustain and even devise new policies that oppress women, we have to be willing to say that, in some measure, they are choosing the economic misfortune that follows.
The developed world’s silence suggests that it takes the mistreatment of black and brown women by black and brown men for granted, rather than holding all people to one standard of justice.
The “surprises” on the Newsweek list confirm that educating women boosts economic prosperity.
Many countries with histories of colonialism and other forms of tyranny, as well as countries without abundant natural resources, have chosen to educate women and grant them legal rights.
Some continue to struggle economically, but none is abjectly poor – and some are booming.
Think of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey.
The low status of women on Planet Worst cannot be blamed on cultural stasis: many of the “surprise” countries – Romania, Portugal, the Philippines, and India – treated women far more unequally a mere 50-100 years ago.
In Pakistan, marital rape is not illegal today, and there are 800 honor killings a year.
What kind of economic boom might stagnating Pakistan enjoy if patriarchy relaxed its grip?
If you are not innumerate, you can start a business.
If you are not living in mortal fear of rape and beatings at home, you can organize your community to dig a new well.
If you are not subjecting your daughter to traumatic genital injury at three and marrying her off at ten, she can go to school. And, when she does marry and has children of her own, they will benefit from two educated, employed parents, which means twice as much literate conversation in the home, twice the contacts, and twice the encouragement to succeed.
Educated, pushy mothers make all the difference.
As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in the Newsweek issue, “The world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women’s potential for growth.
Studies show that helping women access trade and grow businesses helps create jobs and boost incomes.”
But on Planet Worst, forcing terrified, uneducated women to remain at home is more socially acceptable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone.
It is time to stop tiptoeing around the poorest countries’ responsibility to do something essential about their own plight: emancipate their women.
Few concepts are as elastic as that of ``Conservatism.''
At one end of its spectrum of meanings, conservatism has (over the last two decades) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab.
At the other end, conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism.
In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic's failures, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives.
This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian-Social Union (CSU), who focus on moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, and on commanding Germany's political center.
With federal elections due in Germany this autumn, much will be said about the nature of German conservatism.
Some, looking at CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber's emphasis on Bavaria's economic success, will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the ``anything goes'' market conservatism practiced in America.
Others, pointing to the German conservatives' emphasis on social values, will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats.
The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons, which also makes it more durable.
CDU/CSU policies are, of course, founded on the idea of individual freedom, but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition.
We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man's sins, but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany's 20th century history.
Yet, despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature, we embrace humanity's talent for progress and innovation, because we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors.
These two traits, although they seem to conflict, and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires.
Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way, German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state, the market, and the individual.
We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts, such as those that exist between freedom and security.
Each, indeed, is unsustainable without the other.
Security is useless without freedom, but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security.
The social market economy, which we continue to embrace, is based on these principles.
It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth, but also embraces state interference, when necessary, to secure equality of opportunity, social solidarity, and social balance.
This interference is also intended to help avoid the ``economization'' of all aspects of civic life.
The market is merely a tool, not an answer to every human problem.
It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive, for example, to strike a balance between economy and ecology.
We feel responsible, on a global level, for the environment, which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world.
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity.
As we open ourselves to the wind's of globalization, we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity, such as the family, local and regional communities, religious communities, and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years.
This is the principle of ``subsidiarity'' which supports placing decision-making power, wherever and whenever possible, in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen.
This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union, where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe.
For German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warring concepts, as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others.
They are, instead, two sides of the same coin.
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation.
Decades later, the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations, as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations, because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure.
In essence, the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept.
Indeed, only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance, and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy.
In a fast changing world, this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike.
Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future.
Moderation, tolerance, and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today's German conservatism.
LISBON/RIGA – Is the Europe that is emerging from the euro crisis a German one?
During the euro crisis, power in the European Union seems to have shifted towards national capitals in general, and towards one national capital in particular: Berlin.
But, with Germany introverted, France downgraded, and Britain semi-detached, the big story in European foreign policy is that the time has come for the little guy who thinks big.
In this Europe, the important moves are now sometimes made in Stockholm or Warsaw, not only in Berlin, Paris, or London.
And, with major foreign-policy issues on Europe’s doorstep – whether in Egypt, Belarus, or now Syria – useful European initiatives are to be welcomed, regardless of where they originate.
Germany, in foreign policy as well as in economics, can exert decisive leadership in the EU – when it wants to.
For example, together with Poland, it led the EU’s attempt to develop a coordinated approach to Russia, and it flexed its muscles on Serbia.
But, on other issues – for example, Libya – Germany did not so much lead as use its newfound room for maneuver to follow its own preferences in the face of other EU members.
So the answer today to Henry Kissinger’s famous question about whom he should call when he wants to speak to Europe, is not necessarily “the German chancellor.”
While Berlin is increasingly imposing its economic preferences on others in the eurozone, it is not prepared to use military force as a foreign-policy tool, as it demonstrated in the case of Libya.
Moreover, Germany, it seems, is becoming a “geo-economic power” driven by the needs of its export sector.
By using economic means to pursue its foreign-policy ends, Germany is gradually turning its back on its European partners.
Meanwhile, as France experiences a loss of power relative to Germany on economic issues, it continues to play a decisive role in foreign policy.
France led the Libya operation, and is doing much the same with attempts to impose stronger sanctions against Iran and provide support for the United Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.
But France’s unilateral approach often antagonizes its European partners.
For example, French President Nicolas Sarkozy preempted a common European position on the Palestinian statehood bid at the UN in September.
In other words, even when France leads, it does not always do so in a constructive way.
Apart from the decisive role that it played in Libya alongside France, Britain is becoming increasingly marginal in European foreign policymaking.
Even before it vetoed a plan by eurozone countries to create a “fiscal union” at the European summit in December 2011, it was playing less of a leadership role than it traditionally has on key European foreign-policy issues.
Britain has continued to support EU enlargement, closer links with Turkey, and development in Africa, but it has not launched any creative initiatives to bring other member states along or change the terms of the EU debate.
On other issues, such as engaging “strategic partners” – China and Russia in particular – the United Kingdom is often a follower as well.
As the “big three” increasingly pursue their own narrowly defined national interests, however, other EU member states are emerging as leaders in key foreign-policy fields.
For example, Sweden – the 14th largest member state in terms of population, and eighth in terms of GDP – under the leadership of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt punches considerably above its weight.
Last year, it increased annual aid to North Africa by SEK100 million (€11.1 million), proposed an EU mission to Tunisia just a week after the revolution to support democratic aspirations there, and was an early and strong backer of UN resolutions in support of the uprising in Libya.
Poland, too, is emerging as a foreign-policy leader.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski have particularly taken the initiative on the EU’s strategy towards Russia, where Poland has largely overcome its differences with Germany and is now at the forefront of efforts to develop a genuinely comprehensive approach.
Poland has also led on European defense (though it declined to take part in the military intervention in Libya).
This reflects the strength of the Polish economy, which is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012 – faster than almost anywhere else in the EU.
Germany might be getting all of the attention in this time of crisis, but the last year has been a reminder that Europe is most effective and influential when the small countries get involved and join forces with – and even lead – the big ones.
For example, on Iran (with exceptions like Greece), Europeans have united around a clear policy and collective positions, such as an oil embargo.
So, Poland and Sweden:&nbsp; Europe needs your leadership. But that might not be enough in an EU with more than 500 million citizens.
Other EU states need to follow their example in order to make European foreign policy truly effective and influential.
In 2004, the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1%, the fastest pace in the last 28 years.
While Ifo`s World Economic Climate indicator, generated from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, worsened slightly during the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the boom.
In 2005, growth is estimated to have been about 4.3%, and a similar rate can be expected in 2006, marking a period of sustained rapid global growth unseen since the 1970’s.
But the boom is not uniform.
In the United States, the number of experts giving a favorable assessment of the current situation declined; indeed, a majority believes that the economic situation will worsen during the next six months.
However, in the Asian countries, including China, the optimism is unbroken.
The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America.
The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world.
Whereas growth was a miserable 1.5% in 2005 in the 15 “old” members of the European Union, Ifo expects EU-15 growth to accelerate to 2.1% in 2006.
To be sure, economic performance will vary widely among EU countries.
While Italy will be the laggard, with only 1.1% growth, the Irish rocket will not lose its force, pushing real GDP up by about 4.8%.
In general, the big EU countries are still performing badly, in contrast to the smaller members – hardly surprising, given that the EU is basically an institution to help the smaller countries overcome the drawback of their size by extending the agglomeration advantages that formerly were reserved to the bigger countries.
But even Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is experiencing an upswing.
The Ifo climate indicator for Germany, based on monthly surveys of 7,000 firms, jumped upwards in the second half of 2005, reaching its highest value since the boom year 2000, with businesses’ assessment of the current situation and expectations improving.
After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally on the move.
The driving force is external demand, as Germany, the world’s second-largest exporter, profits from the global boom.
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
However, as we saw in 2004 and 2005, exports are not enough to create substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow.
The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now growing, too.
While the second half of 2005 was already quite good, Ifo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6% in 2006.
After many years of contraction, investment in construction also will rise slightly.
Total investment growth is expected to reach 2.9% – weak by past standards, but nonetheless a promising salve for the wounded German mood.
Moreover, any investment growth is vital for Germany, which, according to the latest OECD statistics, currently suffers from the world’s lowest share of net investment in national income.
Even if Germany remains the world’s laggard, rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth, which Ifo estimates at 1.7% in 2006.
That number looks small compared to most other countries.
In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster.
But everything is relative: Germany’s trend growth rate is just 1.1%, and the country has been the slowest growing EU country since 1995.
Measured against a disappointing past, even Germany is currently experiencing an economic boom.
Indeed, even German unemployment, which has been rising in cycles since 1970, will decline slightly in 2006, from 4.8 to 4.7 million.
The good economic data will reinforce initial favorable impressions of Angela Merkel’s new government, which got off to an excellent start at the EU Summit, where Merkel helped to broker a compromise between Britain and France on the Union’s 2007-2013 budget (by adding another €2 billion to Germany’s annual contribution).
In fact, the government may even have contributed a bit to the good economic data by announcing a serious effort to consolidate Germany’s own public finances – a prerequisite for investor confidence.
According to the government, substantial tax increases will bring the fiscal deficit below the 3%-of-GDP limit set by the Stability and Growth Pact – a target missed for five consecutive years – by 2007.
The real test for the German government is the labor market.
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American earned-income tax credit.
In Germany, it’s called “activating social aid” or “combi wages,” but the principle is the same: the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force.
That would widen the wage distribution, create jobs, and maintain the living standard of the poor.
Merkel announced in her inaugural speech in the Bundestag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006.
If this is more than lip service, and if she really carries out a serious reform of the German welfare state’s incentive structure, the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth.
In the long term, that would be more promising for the EU – and for the global economy – than the demand-driven performance that Germany is currently enjoying.
NEW YORK – Late next month, a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth. We will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born.
We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic.
The world’s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945.
And our numbers keep growing, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food, and water. The global economy is generating pressures as well: rising joblessness, widening social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers.
These trends link the fate and future of today’s seven billion people as never before. No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century. International cooperation is a universal need.

The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity’s long-term imperatives.
At a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges, we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice.
To help create this future, I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives – five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today.

The first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development. We all must understand that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security, and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all.

In the next five years, we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement.
Fostering economic growth, realizing the Millennium Development Goals, and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet.
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.
This year, the UN peacekeeping budget will total $8 billion. Think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deploying political mediation missions, for example, rather than troops.
We know how to do this.
Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan.
A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world. In this effort, we must be courageous in standing up for democracy, human rights, and peace.
This year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in Côte d’Ivoire, Darfur, Egypt, and elsewhere. But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace.  
In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate.
Palestinians deserve a state.
Israel needs security.
Both want peace. A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace.
So, too, will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sierra Leone. And, in the name of all of humanity, we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons.
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.
This year’s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.
In Libya, we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country’s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order, consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people.
Syria is a special concern.
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression.
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people.
It has not done so.
The moment to act is now.
The violence must stop.
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.  
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world’s unrealized potential.
We need their full engagement – in government, business, and civil society.
The UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year, for the first time, UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world.
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world’s great global challenges.
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations.
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause.
Let our common agenda begin.
ISTANBUL – The reality of the world’s epic interdependence is well known.
We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and beyond; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe.
We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states, and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament.
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions.
When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient, for example, we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria.
When the Internet became global, its management was turned over to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance – a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism.
The US, as the most powerful member of the international system, tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance.
With its vast resources and alliances, ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules, customs, and structures.
Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law, and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm.
Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods, climate being the most obvious example.
By definition, public goods mean a collective-action problem.
The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability, if not uniformity, in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges.
Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating, while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating.
(The developing world has been largely absent in this debate, with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo, peppered with obstructionism.)
Like many other cardinal questions, the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively.
We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time, with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches.
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue: what responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots?
Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question, and yet without at least some working answer, we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence.
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design.
We cannot establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other – and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities.
The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum, but in the conversations we have with our friends, families, and colleagues.
We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept, and then discuss our answers with others.
This will mean starting to imagine – without panic or rush, and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires – a global civics.
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation.
Whether or not we realize it, we have comparable conversations every day.
For example, every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal, and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing.
A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc, but we cruise carefree, because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers.
Our expectations of other drivers, which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving, can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws, habits, and conventions about how to operate automobiles.
In an increasingly interdependent world, we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease. That framework has to be based on global civics, a system of conscious responsibilities that we are ready to take on – and corresponding rights that we are ready to claim – after due deliberation.
To imagine the shape of global civics, a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being – who will join us in less than a thousand days – about the human condition awaiting her.
This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce, and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation – the essence of global civics.
Mention the United Nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his tenure.
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations.
Reform is in the air – in part because of the scandal, but also because of the UN’s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and, most recently, Sudan.
Even the UN’s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security.
Some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council’s composition.
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run.
This helps to explain why a much-weakened France was made a permanent member of the Council – and why Germany and Japan (and a not-yet independent India) were not.
Defending the Security Council’s current make-up is impossible; the need for change is beyond debate.
But coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult.
Great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat, while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe’s relative over-representation.
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council; Argentina, Chile, and Mexico to adding Brazil; Nigeria to South Africa (and vice-versa); and several countries, including China, Indonesia, and South Korea, might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan.
Clearly, fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort.
In the meantime, there is important work to be done.
One productive avenue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the High Level Panel that was endorsed by Annan; namely, that all UN members go on record declaring that terrorism has no place in today’s world.
This will prove more difficult than it first sounds.
For too long, the international community has tolerated terrorism – the intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants by non-state actors for political purposes – on the grounds that, on occasion, “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past.
We do not.
Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated, much less supported.
Weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons – are just that, and no cause can excuse their use.
Moreover, as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed, weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern, global life.
Terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims.
Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American, Russian, European, and UN assistance.
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution.
No one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group’s only option.
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.
A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking, the hijacking of civilian aircraft, and terrorism more broadly.
Similarly, the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force, created in 1989 to curb money laundering, has grown and become focused mainly on curbing terrorist financing.
UN Security Council Resolution 1373, passed after the September 11 attacks, calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists, bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism, suppress recruitment by terrorist groups, block terrorists’ efforts to acquire weapons, and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspects and boosting security.
What is missing is a new, 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not.
Broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable, and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished.
Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism. But ideas matter.
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.
Doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out.
We are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means.
It is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost.
NAIROBI – With unemployment soaring, bankruptcies climbing, and stock markets in free-fall, it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold.
But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions.
Far from burdening an already over-stressed, over-stretched global economy, environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books flowing, and assist in powering economies back to health.
In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity – a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet.
A big slice of President Barack Obama’s $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy, “weatherizing” a million homes, and upgrading the country’s inefficient electricity grid.
Such investments could generate an estimated five million “green-collar” jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security.
The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times.
President Lee Myung-Bak’s government plans to invest $38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities.
Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills.
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.
Similar pro-employment “Green New Deal” packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs, fighting poverty, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports.
In South Africa, the government-backedWorking for Water initiative – which employs more than 30,000 people, including women, youth, and the disabled – also sees opportunity in crisis.
The country spends roughly $60 million annually fighting invasive alien plants that threaten native wildlife, water supplies, important tourism destinations, and farmland.
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.
As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country’s electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs.
So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery.
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.
In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world’s leading economists at the UN’s headquarters in New York.
A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts.
The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise.
Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century.
The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes, together with the trillions of investors’ dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss.
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children’s future.
Instead, political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and encourage new patterns of decent, long-lasting employment.
LONDON – US President Barack Obama caught the imagination of the world when he talked recently of a new “Sputnik moment.”
He outlined a bold plan for improving education, infrastructure, and technology, and vividly compared the resolve required to put a man on the moon to the determination needed to restore growth to the US economy.

Obama is right to say that the West faces not only great challenges, but also great opportunities.&nbsp;In the last decade, the global economy was transformed by one billion Asian workers entering the ranks of industrial producers.&nbsp;In 2011, for the first time in two centuries, Europe and America face being out-produced, out-exported, and out-invested by China and the rest of the world.
Yet Asia’s growth also gives the West unprecedented economic hope.
In this decade, the world will be transformed&nbsp;yet again by the rise of the Asian consumer.&nbsp;By 2020, Asia’s domestic markets will be twice the size of America’s.
The world’s middle class will have swelled from one billion consumers to three billion.
The opportunities for growth in Europe and the US from this additional global demand are enormous.
The countries and companies that will flourish in Asia’s new markets will be those that can provide the technology-driven, custom-built, high value-added goods and services needed to serve Asia’s two billion consumers.
But neither Europe nor the US is in a strong enough position to take best advantage of these new markets.
The West must again begin to out-invent, out-innovate, and out-skill the rest of the world if it is to seize the opportunities that Asia presents.&nbsp;Indeed, unless the West significantly expands its capital investment in engineering, science, and new technologies, it will be marginalized by countries whose governments back their innovators with hard cash.
Obama’s investment plan could be the foundation stone for a formal global agreement that delivers higher levels of growth to all corners of the world and creates millions of new jobs.
Under such an agreement, Europe would join the US in raising levels of investment – complementing America’s “moonshot”&nbsp;initiative with a program of structural reform aimed at building a digital, green, energy-efficient, and competitive economy – while China would play its part by increasing its consumption.
I believe that such an agreement could boost the world economy by around 3% by 2014 – and lift 100 million people out of poverty.
I presented this plan when I chaired the G-20 in London in 2009.
I wanted East and West to commit to a formal strategy to deliver more enduring results than those promised by the rescue packages that we were putting together at the time.
Our attention was focused on preventing recession from turning into depression.
I argued that this was also the moment to pioneer a more lasting framework of growth.
In the end, no agreement was possible on a shared growth objective, and there has not yet&nbsp;been enough political will for the coordinated action to achieve it.
Since then, Europe and America have grown well below their capacity (despite huge unmet demand throughout the world) and unemployment has climbed to around 10% on both continents (with youth unemployment reaching an alarming 20%).
The global growth agreement that evaded us in 2009 remains the unfinished work of the G-20.
Front-loaded public investment could be funded through an enhanced European Investment Bank.
China has already laid the foundation for playing its part: its policy of xiaokang (reducing poverty and expanding the middle class) should create a market for billions of dollars of&nbsp;Western goods and services.
The West should propose that if China’s consumption increases by 2-4 percentage points of its GDP over the next three years (entirely possible as it improves its social safety net, cuts taxes, and puts homeownership within reach of ordinary citizens), America and Europe will expand their public investment by similar amounts.
If other Asian countries do likewise, and agree to create a level playing field for exporters, we could create around 50 million additional jobs.
Of course, in the West, an investment plan invites criticism from those who prefer that we do nothing but talk about growth strategies.
Indeed, critics argue that raising public investment conflicts with the drive to reduce deficits, and warn of higher interest rates on the back of further spending.
But critics are wrong about the impact on the deficit&nbsp;of focused investment.
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund produced unequivocal evidence that we can actually maintain deficit-reduction plans while benefiting from the additional capital investment that the US and European economies need.
My extrapolation of the IMF model shows that Western countries can boost their long-term GDP growth significantly by increasing their levels of capital investment over a three-year period.
An annual stimulus equivalent to just 0.3% of GDP yields a return in the US of 0.8% in economic growth at its peak in 2013, and 0.4% in Europe.
This approach, which secures growth and cuts unemployment without raising the deficit, is needed to energize the private sector and mobilize some of the capital that has accumulated on corporate balance sheets in recent years.
It also underscores the importance of the G-20 and the IMF in seeking global consensus now.
The West is well placed to play its part in global renewal.
Its extraordinary workforces produce world-class goods and services. But the West’s workforce must not be condemned to policies that willfully produce a decade of slow growth and low employment.
That would be a human tragedy, not just an economic disaster.
NEW YORK – Dark, lowering financial and economic clouds are, it seems, rolling in from every direction: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere.
Indeed, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter.
For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, as the euro remains too strong, front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery.
The eurozone banking system is becoming balkanized, as cross-border and interbank credit lines are cut off, and capital flight could turn into a full run on periphery banks if, as is likely, Greece stages a disorderly euro exit in the next few months.
Moreover, fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels.
Indeed, the eurozone may require not just an international bailout of banks (as recently in Spain), but also a full sovereign bailout at a time when eurozone and international firewalls are insufficient to the task of backstopping both Spain and Italy.
As a result, disorderly breakup of the eurozone remains possible.
Farther to the west, US economic performance is weakening, with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9% – well below potential.
And job creation faltered in April and May, so the US may reach stall speed by year end.
Worse, the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising: even if what looks like a looming US fiscal cliff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag, the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption.
Moreover, political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November’s presidential election.
Thus, new fights on the debt ceiling, risks of a government shutdown, and rating downgrades could further depress consumer and business confidence, reducing spending and accelerating a flight to safety that would exacerbate the fall in stock markets.
In the east, China, its growth model unsustainable, could be underwater by 2013, as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late.
A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption’s share of GDP; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform, together with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition, suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough.
The economic slowdown in the US, the eurozone, and China already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets, owing to their trade and financial links with the US and the European Union (that is, no “decoupling” has occurred).
At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets, together with their move towards greater state capitalism, is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency.
Finally, long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013.
The current negotiations are likely to fail, and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons.
With the US and Israel unwilling to accept containment of a nuclear Iran by deterrence, a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spike and global recession.
These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown: equity markets are falling everywhere, leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending.
Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies, and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries’ income.
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling.
Compared to 2008-2009, when policymakers had ample space to act, monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bullets (or, more cynically, policy rabbits to pull out of their hats).
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.
Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises.
Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus.
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public deleveraging is suppressing domestic demand in countries that are running current-account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries.
After all, a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others.
Meanwhile, the ability to backstop, ring-fence, and bail out banks and other financial institutions is constrained by politics and near-insolvent sovereigns’ inability to absorb additional losses from their banking systems.
As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk.
Indeed, sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks’ balance sheet, especially in the eurozone.
To prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone, today’s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual, a growth compact should complement the EU’s new fiscal compact, and a fiscal union with debt mutualization (Eurobonds) should be implemented.&nbsp; In addition, a full banking union, starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance, should be initiated, and moves toward greater political integration must be considered, even as Greece leaves the eurozone.
Unfortunately, Germany resists all of these key policy measures, as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic, fiscal, and banking integration.
As a result, the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising.
And, while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst, it is not the only one threatening the global economy.
Batten down the hatches.
NEW YORK – Great social change occurs in several ways.
A technological breakthrough – the steam engine, computers, the Internet – may play a leading role.
Visionaries, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, may inspire a demand for justice.
Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change.
This time, we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe.
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily.
Heat waves, droughts, floods, forest fires, retreating glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate, owing to human activities.
Our $70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment.
We will need new technologies, behaviors, and ethics, supported by solid evidence, to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability.
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society.
At the political level, the UN is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law, as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992.
At the level of global society, the UN represents the world’s citizenry, “we the peoples,” as it says in the UN Charter.&nbsp; At the societal level, the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us, including future generations.
In the past two decades, governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats.
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.
Ban knows that strong government action remains vital, but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role, especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests, and too few politicians think in time horizons that extend past the next election.
To empower global society to act, Ban has launched a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful to volunteer.
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new, cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world.
The network will work alongside and support governments, UN agencies, civil-society organizations, and the private sector.
Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build livable cities, and manage the global commons of oceans, biodiversity, and the atmosphere. But time is running very short.
Today’s mega-cities, for example, already have to confront dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, dire congestion, and air and water pollution.
Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility. And as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport, energy needs, water supplies, or food supplies, those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base, enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well.
Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network. Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America’s “land-grant” universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science.
Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food supplies, and the rest.
By linking together, and putting their curricula online, the world’s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems.
The world’s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development.
Now the corporate sector has two faces.
It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies, pioneering research and development, world-class management, and leadership in environmental sustainability. Yet at the same time, the corporate sector lobbies aggressively to gut environmental regulations, slash corporate-tax rates, and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction.
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects, thereby accelerating global learning cycles.
Equally important, we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their peers to cease the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that account for the inaction of governments.&nbsp;
Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term task.
The reinvention of energy, food, transport, and other systems will take decades, not years. But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction.
We must start reinventing our productive systems now, precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing.&nbsp;
At the Rio+20 Summit this past June, the world’s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015, to build upon the Millennium Development Goals’ success in reducing poverty, hunger, and disease.
In the post-2015 era, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand, reinforcing each other.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open, participatory, and knowledge-based way.&nbsp;
The Secretary General’s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely.
Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development, but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives.&nbsp;
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents’ tables doesn’t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone.
That may sound obvious, but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating.
For example, Italian politicians, who, given Italy’s recent dismal economic performance, would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy, are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts.
Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain “if someone is pushing on the brake pedal.”
Who’s he kidding?
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy.
More than the usual “blame game” is at work here.
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates – and Berlusconi and Co.’s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy.
Soaring energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk. But higher energy prices, by themselves, will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger.
The key will be so-called “second-round effects” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions.
So far, the “social partners,” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have been quiet.
Should this change, the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe’s economic growth remains slack.
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up (even in Italy).
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3% year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging.
How will the ECB react to better economic news?
Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years). True, there is no inflation problem in the short run, but the ECB’s monetary policy focuses on the medium term.
One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB’s benchmark level, indicating an excess supply of liquidity. It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question.
Slow growth has silenced the monetarists on the ECB’s Governing Council.
This will change, however, once the economic pick-up is confirmed. Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy.
Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats’ candidate, is a reformer, holding out hope for Germany’s future – and that of Europe.
Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.
This would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes. Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, companies might hold off on investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even less clear than it is now.

On the other hand, a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action.
This raises an interesting point.
The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates, because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way, and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed.
A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening.
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth.
Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi, who have failed to put bread on the table, their minions in the media, and Keynesian economic professors who don’t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view.
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth.
The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie.
Though Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel’s old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to conduct business with America’s blessing.
The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980’s, through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point.
Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change.
It was during Yitzhak Rabin’s government in the early 1990’s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment after America’s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accords, Israel’s peace agreement with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel’s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran’s worst nightmare.
It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran, two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East, chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms.
The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire, and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians.
More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such, the Mullahs’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran’s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses.
In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader.
Ironically, Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy, for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq.
Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching.
As an anti-status quo power, Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order.
But Israel has every reason to be concerned, for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel’s own strategy of “nuclear ambiguity” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region.
It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way.
A military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is too dangerous, and its results uncertain. And, however severe economic sanctions might be, they might not bring Iran to its knees.
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon.
However, being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism.
In the American-Iranian equation it was the US, not Iran, that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy.
Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference.
Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan. And, when US forces overran Saddam Hussein’s army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas.
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
But, neo-conservative haughtiness – “We don’t speak to evil” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran’s demarche.
Iran’s mood changed by the time America’s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse.
This would not be achieved, however, through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America’s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran’s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race.
Iran’s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures, which are far lower than those of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power.
There is no better way to undercut Iran’s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investments in human development, and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel.
CAMBRIDGE – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today’s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious.
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems.
So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?
I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate.
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.
Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union, which can lead only through constitutional change, the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable.
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
That may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized.
And, if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation.
Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high.
Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?
First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro.
But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered.
Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value.
Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere.
Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value.
Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies.
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro’s strength, the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee, just as private investors would, only in a faster and more concentrated way.
Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s.
True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits.
Whereas the US Congress’s “supercommittee,” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package, will likely come up with a proposal, it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year.
Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar.
Fifth, the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis.&#160; An exchange rate of $1.4:€1 is cheap for Germany’s export powerhouse, which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro.
For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage.
Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis, wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards, even as productivity has remained stagnant.
But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range.
Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed.
Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”
A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon.
So, yes, there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro, despite its drawn-out crisis, has remained so firm against the dollar so far.
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to cope with Greece’s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country’s debt burden.
In essence, this is a back-door debt restructuring: Europe’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default.
A recurrent characteristic of Europe’s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980’s.
Bolivia’s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt, an operation funded by international donors, is a classic example.
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign (debt repudiation was part of his platform), and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch.
The reasons invoked by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange) were beside the point.
The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back at a discount through the back door.
That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “vulture” investors.
To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned.
With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands, and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff, the operation was a success.
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the market response.
Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields, it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador’s behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices, could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange.
This is particularly notable, given that Ecuador’s was perhaps the first opportunistic default (triggered by unwillingness, rather than inability, to pay) in recent history.
The second lesson, and the one most pertinent to Europe now, concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario.
Indeed, almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount.
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “credit event” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices.
The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (that is, that private bondholders take a real hit) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005.
In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50%.
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out.
Only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring.
In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to default.
Can Greece, with the EFSF’s help, obtain debt relief while avoiding default?
Small purchases at current panic prices, vulture-fund style, are always possible, but they do not promise substantial debt relief.
Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market, defeating the point of the whole operation.
And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced.
But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way, say, by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market?
Naturally, the spread would automatically converge to the threshold, but how much would be sold?
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders?
If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount, the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal.
After all, by capping spreads, the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason, perhaps, to make the facility a temporary offer.
By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders.
A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to succeed in inducing a haircut, it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate.
Without Ecuador’s gimmicks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece’s debt overhang.
OXFORD – While austerity in Europe faces increasing social resistance, in principle it has the merit of simplicity.
As the debate on fiscal consolidation versus growth intensifies, it is clear that there is little agreement on how to kick-start the economy, beyond fielding broad stimulus packages.
One idea is that environmental technology might feed a virtuous cycle of innovation and employment.
To some, green growth evokes a countryside covered with windmills and urban roofs lined with solar panels. But it is broader than that.
For example, when Airbus moved from injection molding to 3D printing to produce the metal hinges for its airplanes’ doors, it reduced their weight by half, yielding phenomenal savings in material and associated fuel consumption over a lifetime of flying those hinges around the world.
Still, it is easier to find exciting anecdotes than it is to show how they scale up to revitalizing an entire economy.
Moreover, there is a great diversity of narratives on the green economy – and their proliferation is likely to grow.
This June, thousands of activists, policymakers, and business people will converge on Rio de Janeiro for the third giant United Nations Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20), whose theme is the green economy.
The conference will unleash new arguments about green jobs, growth, cost increases, cost reductions, changes in values, consumer choice – green this and green that.
As a co-author of A New Growth Path for Europe, a report commissioned by the German government, I am guilty of contributing to this cacophony of complementary perspectives on green growth.
The European Climate Foundation had already published its Roadmap 2050, A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe.
Since then, the UN Environment Program has released its Green Economy Report; McKinsey has written about the Resource Revolution; and the International Trade Unions Council has published Growing Green and Decent Jobs – to name but a few.
All take somewhat different approaches and offer different recommendations, making it hard for policymakers to see the forest through the trees. And, at the root of this multiplicity of perspectives lays the fact that economics struggles to explain how growth and innovation move an economy as a whole.
The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution, but green growth is not about gradual change.
For example, the European Union’s goal of achieving an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 implies a complete overhaul of EU infrastructure in just a few decades.
Economists’ inability to model such rapid, radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge, and of the fact that the economy is really, really complicated.
We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt.
Yet, the studies of green growth mentioned above all appear to provide such explanations.
So, what do they really tell us?
In practice, each is limited to just one or two aspects of the economy, and describes how these interact.
Growing Green and Decent Jobs looks at the relationship between investment and jobs.
A New Growth Path for Europe examines the impact of expectations and learning-by-doing.
Roadmap 2050 focuses on greening the power system.
The authors then make a leap of faith to derive conclusions about the economy as a whole.
But, while the value of these studies is in the light that they shed on the parts, the ensuing headlines invariably are about the whole, articulated in terms of GDP and jobs.
Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability.
That said, the fact that one cannot prove conclusively how green growth would work does not mean that we should give up on the idea.
We know from history that waves of innovation, from the steam engine to the information and communications revolution, have led to dramatic increases in economic growth.
We cannot prove that a wave of environmental innovation will have a similar effect, but the studies of the parts make such an outcome highly plausible.
As humans, we are uniquely equipped to make decisions on the basis of ambiguous information – in fact, we do it all the time.
When we choose a career or a spouse in our private lives, or when a politician seizes an opportunity from a plethora of possibilities, the task at hand is always about making highly consequential decisions based on imperfect information.
A big pile of green-growth reports demonstrates the plausibility of this path to recovery from an historic economic crisis.
It is now up to us to realize its potential.
Green growth offers a realistic alternative to the faltering austerity approach to overcoming the current economic crisis.
Policymakers should incorporate this thinking into the “beyond austerity” narrative that is taking shape in a growing number of key EU member states.
THE HAGUE – Mitigating climate change is often presented as imposing a trade-off between the economy and the environment.
For too long, the debate has been framed around the concept of “burden-sharing.”
But new analysis by a team from six leading European universities and institutes casts new light on this debate, and shows that Europe can make choices that are in its own best economic and environmental interest.
The analysis contained in our new report, A New Growth Path for Europe – Generating Prosperity and Jobs in the Low-Carbon Economy, is based on a comprehensive assessment of European growth prospects in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
Its publication is timely, because the European Union will decide this year whether to raise its target for greenhouse-gas reduction.
Increasing the current emissions target from -20% to -30% by 2020 compared to 1990 would represent an important opportunity to revitalize the European economy – independently of what the rest of the world did in terms of climate policy.
Over the coming decade, seizing that opportunity would increase the size of Europe’s economy considerably – by up to 5% over the next decade.
This translates into six million new jobs and an increase in GDP of up to €800 billion by 2020.
The reason for these results is straightforward: increasing Europe’s climate-policy efforts boosts investments, thus inducing learning-by-doing, especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials.
Learning-by-doing, in turn, increases competitiveness and spurs economic growth, thereby improving investors’ expectations – and inducing further investment.
Unfortunately, studies of the economic impact of a -30% target have relied on traditional equilibrium models that neglect these multiplier effects.
Their estimates of the economic consequences of raising the target result in moderate additional costs, ranging from 0-2% of GDP in 2020.
The new study uses an approach similar to that underpinning Germany’s 2020 emissions-reduction target of -40%.
At last year’s United Nations-sponsored climate-change conference in Cancún, Mexico, German Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen noted that, “In Germany, there has been a shift in thinking over the past years: in industry, politics, and society, we now see climate policy as an opportunity and challenge, not as a threat.”
Röttgen is right.
Imagine a gathering of textile entrepreneurs in 1800 debating whether to introduce steam machines to mechanize their cotton mills.
One of them calculates that the costs would be prohibitive across their hundreds of plants.
If the rest accepted this bottom-up calculation, society would miss out on the 0.5% boost to annual growth that this radical innovation ultimately brought about.
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills.
It was not the invention of the steam engine alone that deserves the credit.
Then as now, such breakthroughs generate a cascade of learning and innovation as suppliers, contractors. and customers adapt to a new way of operating.
Every new major technological idea – the steam engine, railways, or the personal computer – adds up to a boost to growth.
A New Growth Path for Europe shows how investing in energy efficiency and clean energy has the same potential to revitalize Europe today.
Indeed, Josef Ackermann, Chairman of Deutsche Bank, recently said that such investments augur “a new industrial revolution – a revolution that will transform the way we live.”
The analysis shows how all major economic sectors – including many energy-intensive industries – will grow.
For example, energy-efficient buildings are a boon to the cement and chemical industries.
Obviously, the fossil-fuel sector would shrink by 2020 as the energy system decarbonizes, with coal being partly displaced by lower-carbon fuels, mainly gas and renewables (carbon capture and storage and nuclear power cannot make much of a difference by 2020).
The new EU member states, which have lower energy efficiency, stand to benefit the most – though substantial hurdles must be overcome with additional support mechanisms.
Because the financial crisis has lowered greenhouse-gas emissions, the -20% reduction target set before the crisis is no longer challenging enough to catalyze a structural shift in the European economy.
And, as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change, economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future.
A New Growth Path for Europe supports that optimism, and it calls on the EU to act accordingly.
One crucial insight to be gained from a century of establishing international courts and tribunals is that while momentum is vital, getting things right from the start is equally important.
With little fanfare, January 25, 2004, marked a milestone in the history of the protection of human rights in Africa: the entry into force of the Protocol for establishing an African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.
After Europe and the Americas, Africa will be the third continent with a regional court to redress human rights violations.
Acceptance of the Protocol in the last year by such influential African countries as Algeria, South Africa, and Libya gave the final and sudden impetus to the Court's establishment, and the critical threshold of fifteen ratifications was reached shortly before the New Year, when the Comoros signed on.
But it is in countries like Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda, and Uganda, which have all ratified the Protocol, that the Court will likely play a major role in checking human rights abuses.
It can do so because the Court's judgments will be legally binding and thus enforceable in national courts.
In states that accepted the Court's jurisdiction, individuals will be able to gain access to the Court directly, even to file cases against their own governments.
African NGO's will be able to ask the Court for advisory opinions, thus strengthening the effectiveness of the African human rights regime.
Clearly, the birth of an African human rights court should be celebrated.
But it risks foundering in the docks, and its launch should therefore be deliberate, not rushed.
The process is now progressing at a startling - and worrying - pace.
Nominations for the first judges have been requested by the end of April, with the aim of holding elections at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa on July 5-7.
Experience elsewhere suggests that once judges have been appointed, rules of procedure drafted and adopted, and the relationship with other international organs shaped, the system will become fixed.
Whatever faults and shortcomings are built in at the beginning will become locked in.
But building a sound international judicial body cannot be rushed; it requires time and resources - both human and financial - and a lot of support.
It took more than four years to physically establish the International Criminal Court, and it took a massive effort by the United Nations, several major countries, and hundreds of experts, NGO's, and think tanks to get this done.
Admittedly, sometimes time is a luxury.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR) opened for work in less than a year in order to begin addressing heinous crimes that were ongoing.
But the price of that rush job is evident: as cases started flowing in, the courts' governing statute and rules of procedure and evidence had to be patched on the fly.
The statute of the ICTY has been amended four times and the rules of procedure and evidence no less than twenty-seven times.
Figures for the ICTR are only slightly better.
That is a poor record for any court of law, which should afford defendants certainty and procedural fairness.
All this tinkering could be done because there was an extraordinary consensus in the UN Security Council on the need not to delay the trials.
But such agreement is extraordinary.
For courts established by treaty, like the African Court, it will likely prove very hard, if not impossible, to find the majority necessary to support changes.
Moreover, effective courts must be politically independent.
But this can be achieved only if the right conditions are in place from the onset.
The process for nominating judges at the national level is critical.
Candidates who are adequate - and who are widelyseen to be adequate - are the key to the Court's legitimacy.
In the European human rights system, the nominating process involves civil society and severe scrutiny by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
It is only through an open, transparent process that the best candidates - those who give the greatest guarantees of independence - can be identified.
But that takes time.
Moreover, the first bench of any international court is critically important, because it is entrusted to prepare and adopt other key documents - such as the rules of procedure, internal regulations, and financial regulations - that will govern the court for years to come.
When they meet in July in Addis Ababa, African heads of state would be better off discussing where the court will be located, how it will be financed, and, most importantly, agreeing standards for an open, participatory, and transparent process for electing its judges.
They should not rush into nominating judges for a court that is still largely on the drawing board.
Africa is poised to establish its own human rights tribunal, fifty years after Europe, 25 years after the Americas, and two years after the International Criminal Court.
But, above all, Africa needs a human rights court that commands the unreserved and unmitigated respect of the continent's governments and peoples.
Africa's leaders should take a few more months to do it right.
Atlanta &#45;&#45; The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air, or land. An entire population is being brutally punished.
This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006.
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.
Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza.  Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet.
Regardless of one’s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water, food, electricity, and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza, about one million of whom are refugees.
Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children.
Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3.
Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age.
On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis.
One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza.
I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants.
Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria.
I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period.
They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused.
Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected.
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community.
Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “security.”
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.
Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people.
This holds promise of progress, but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, a retrogression has occurred in the process.
Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened.
It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly.
It is time for strong voices in Europe, the US, Israel, and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people. 
CHICAGO – The world’s first “quantum” computer – a machine that harnesses the magic of quantum phenomena to perform memory and processing tasks incredibly faster than today’s silicon-based computer chips – was recently sold by D-Wave Systems of Canada to Lockheed-Martin.
And, while some question whether the machine is truly a quantum computer, its designers have published articles in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits.
This spring marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity – the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss.
Currents set up in superconducting wires can exist for years without any measurable decay.
Because of this property, superconductors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways.
They can carry enormous amounts of current, making them ideal for urban power grids.
And, when wound into coils, they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields.
Such superconducting magnets have been applied in a variety of technologies.
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines found in most hospitals.
Perhaps the most exotic are the huge magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider, which seeks to discover the fundamental principles of matter.
Despite their great promise, however, superconductors have limits, the primary one being that most superconduct at very low temperatures – indeed, near absolute zero (-273 ºC).
Such temperatures can be achieved only through liquid-helium cooling.
Thus, Swiss researchers caused excitement in 1986 by announcing the discovery of superconductivity in an oxide of copper at twice the temperature of the previous record holder.
Shortly thereafter, researchers in the United States found a related material that superconducts above the temperature at which air liquefies.
As Time magazine proclaimed in May 1987, with the discovery of these so-called “cuprates,” the superconducting revolution had begun.
Alas, the revolution soon bogged down.
Cuprates are notoriously difficult materials to work with, because they are very brittle.
This is exacerbated by their strong anisotropy – the materials have a quasi-two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly coupled stack of conducting sheets.
As such, they are a challenge for industry, though applications are beginning to appear.
Since the cuprates first appeared, a variety of other “high temperature” superconductors have been discovered – one is a simple compound of magnesium and boron, and another involves a mixture of iron and arsenic.
Although none of them superconduct at temperatures as high as liquid air, they may ultimately be better materials with which to work.
Given the vast number of combinations of elements that can form compounds, there is a good chance that better superconductors await our discovery.
In the coming years, superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology.
Already, “second generation” cuprate wires are being used to make high-capacity cables for electric-power transmission, and lighter-weight generators for wind turbines.
Stronger superconducting magnets are leading to the development of MRIs with more sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.
Superconductors are being used for levitated trains in high-speed rail transport, and as microwave filters for improved signal bandwidth in cellular base stations.
The discovery of a new superconductor with enhanced properties could lead to even greater technological innovation.
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors.
It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of how the phenomenon occurs.
Along the way, a number of famous physicists tried and failed to get the answer – Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman being notable examples.
Discovering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques.
What had been difficult to figure out was how to get electrons to superconduct.
The basic discovery of BCS was that if the electrons pair up, those couples could indeed superconduct.
Fortunately, the mechanism for such coupling was known.
Although electrons are negatively charged, and therefore repel one another, the positive ions that they leave behind when they flow through a metal can mediate an effective attraction between two electrons under restrictive conditions (for example, the metal must be very cold).
The suspicion, though, is that this is not the case in the new superconductors.
Cuprates superconduct at much higher temperatures, but, more importantly, they possess some exotic properties: they are formed by doping electrical carriers into a host material that is a magnetic insulator – the last place one would look for a conventional superconductor.
And, unlike BCS theory, in which the pairs are isotropic – with identical properties in all directions in space – the pairs in cuprates are strongly anisotropic, resembling a cloverleaf.
How can one pair electrons without ions holding them together, thereby enabling higher-temperature superconductors?
While ideas about this abound, new theoretical breakthroughs most likely will be needed to develop the machinery required to solve such electron-electron theories, perhaps even involving black holes.
Whatever the theory turns out to be, it is certain to revolutionize physics.
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system.
Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government.
The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding.
The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net.
Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling.
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests.
Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due.
The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP.
So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced.
As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch.  It will also revise the supplementary budget as well.
But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen.
To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister.
Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees.
The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them.
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society.
Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state.
As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well.
They will most likely succeed.
LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament).
Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters.
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity.
The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers.
The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged.
Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions.
And what of the LDP?
Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds.
Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities.
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups.
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role.
CAMBRIDGE – Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession?
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster.
Some financiers, like Bernard Madoff, will go to prison for fraud.
But, although Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial malfeasance, most suspect financiers need not fear arrest, either because their behavior merely skirted the law, or because financial impropriety more subtle than outright fraud is often difficult to prove.
Some bank bosses will retire in shame, but with huge payments to ease their pain – such as the $55 million golden parachute handed to Bank of America’s Ken Lewis, with his, and the £25 million pension bestowed on Royal Bank of Scotland’s Fred Godwin.
But, buoyed by government bailout money, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation.
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
From 2007 to October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63% to 58.5%.
The unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10%, duration of joblessness was the longest since the Great Depression, millions had had their working hours cut, and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to seek work.
Advanced Europe, Canada, and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time.
Spain, which allows for widespread temporary contracts, has had the biggest increase in unemployment, because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US.
Some countries – for example, Germany, Sweden, and South Korea – have “hidden” their joblessness by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll.
This can work in the short term, but it cannot be sustained over time.
From the 1980’s through the mid-2000’s, employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries.
In the US, there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the latter part of the 1990’s, and there was a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 slowdown.
In the early 1990’s, Sweden suffered a huge recession precipitated by a housing bubble and a banking crisis.
Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001.
Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990.
In 1997, Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis, but also from insistence by the US and the International Monetary Fund that it raise interest rates and undertake “Washington Consensus”-style reforms to receive aid.
Employment recovered, but primarily in “non-regular” jobs with limited benefits, low wages, and little job security.
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest (behind the US) among advanced OECD countries.
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being.
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives.
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member.
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon.
From 1993 to 1998, the US created millions of jobs, which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points.
If employment began rising at this rate in 2010, it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level.
And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries, reducing their employment as well.
A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce.
From the early 1990’s on, many analysts viewed America’s weak unionization, at-will employment, limited legal job protection, and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries.
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines.
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable.
In its 2009 Employment Outlook , the OECD took a hard look at its favored policy reforms and found them deficient in helping countries adjust to a finance-driven recession.
According to the OECD, “there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns.”
So the lesson from the recession is clear.
The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market, but the financial market.
At worst, labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society, whereas capital-market failures harm society greatly, with workers, rather than the perpetrators of financial disaster, suffering the most.
Moreover, globalization means that the US capital market’s failure spreads misery around the world.
We owe it to workers victimized by this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy, instead of enriching only the financiers.
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.
Since other countries’ economies and jobs are also at stake, they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms.
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time. But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased.
Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey. But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns.
In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone.
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.
Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West.
For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe.
It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs.
It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day.
Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker.
Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel.
Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus.
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes.
If this pledge is adopted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace.
In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?
We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances.
After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges.
Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided.
Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.
But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation.
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region.
In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations.
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.
Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest.
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul’s visit to Yerevan, real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries’ closed border – the last in Europe.
Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational.
If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show.
President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era.
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured.
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera’s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past.
Other examples come to mind: the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa, Romania’s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade’s fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged “Jewish monopoly of suffering” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag.
Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself.
A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe.
In country after country, that Manichean mindset, with its oversimplifications and manipulations, was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power. 
Opportunism has had its share in this, of course.
In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989, it had almost four million.
One day after Nicolae Ceausescu’s execution, most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades.
Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel, both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society.
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communistnomenklatura, untouchable in their comfortable villas and retirements, must derive great pleasure from watching today’s witch hunts and manipulation of old files for immediate political purposes.
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.
In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old Communist, reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend’s girlfriend.
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
Kundera’s name was contained in the investigating officer’s report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive.
The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”
Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him.
Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.” Butif it happened, the case calls for a deeper reflection.
As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated.
Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950’s was the most brutal period of “proletarian dictatorship” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers, fierce opponents, and apathetic bystanders alike.
Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique.
In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS.
Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police.
Daily life under totalitarianism, be it communist or fascist, was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding.
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability. We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist’s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work. 
But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses?
An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police.
Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?
Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules toall the captives of that ordeal.
In order to understand that epoch, we have to know and carefully judge often ambiguous and overwhelming circumstances, never simplifying a multilayered daily reality for the sake of current political goals.
If nothing else, in order to forgive, we have to know what we are forgiving.
In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson.
Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality.
PARIS – The newspaper commentaries that I write often have a dark perspective.
Sadly, this one will be no different. But there are two pieces of good news that break through the gloom.
First, the global significance of US President Barack Obama’s reelection is clear: the world has escaped a disaster for international cooperation.
The US was on the verge of sinking into isolationist nationalism, reinforced, perhaps, by xenophobic sentiment.
Obama’s victory, despite America’s economic travails, clears the way for cooperation based on a sympathetic ear to others and on negotiations in which the US does not deny the legitimacy of a global public interest (as it has done, unfortunately, on the issue of climate change).
The other piece of good news concerns France, and thus is more “local,” but is crucially important nonetheless.
Like everywhere else in the developed world, the global crisis has hit the French economy hard, with output stagnating, unemployment rising, job insecurity mounting, government debt soaring, and the stock market at risk of crashing.
Manufacturing production has plummeted, the trade balance has deteriorated sharply, and corporate bankruptcies are increasingly frequent.
For six months, France has had new leadership – a new president, government, and parliament. But President François Hollande and his government were strangely inactive after the elections, limiting themselves to reducing the impact of unfair budget cuts and taxation reforms implemented by the previous government of Nicolas Sarkozy.
Many began to wonder whether Hollande was aware of the scope of the crisis that the recent downturn might trigger.
In recent weeks, however, the government has introduced energetic and courageous measures to boost the competitiveness of French industries, including a huge €20 billion ($26 billion) tax break for businesses, to be financed by a hike in value-added tax, which means that the general public will pay for it.
The VAT increase will hurt, but there was no other way.
Awareness, boldness, and comprehensive policymaking have come as a relief to French investors, and have left them better positioned to face the crisis.
The French government’s new push to confront the country’s economic plight matters not only to France, but to Europe and the world as well.
After all, France is the eurozone’s second-largest economy, and the fifth-largest economy in the world.
And yet, despite these bright spots, international cooperation on issues ranging from regional conflicts to the protection of global public goods remains weak.
Antarctica, the only land in the world that is administered directly by the international community, is a recent case in point.
The Antarctic Treaty, negotiated in 1959, prohibits any and all military activities in Antarctica and forbids the establishment of any borders.
Three agreements – the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972), the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR, 1980), and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (PEP, 1991), which prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources – have since been added to the treaty.
The Antarctic Treaty System includes three annual meetings: one deals with the supervision and management of the Treaty itself, and the other two concern the CCAMLR and the PEP.
In recent years, proposals have been considered that would establish marine reserves around the continent and end the risk of growing scarcity, or the outright disappearance, of a variety of species of fish and cetaceans.
The principle that international cooperation is required to protect fishery resources, which are dwindling everywhere, was adopted at the 2011 CCAMLR meeting.
At the 2012 CCAMLR meeting, which concluded at the beginning of November in Hobart, Australia, three proposals (from the US, New Zealand, and France/Australia) to establish marine reserves in three different areas were discussed.
They were compatible and would reinforce one another.
Yet the discussion foundered, and no decision was taken.
Russia and Ukraine – and, to a lesser extent, China – blocked efforts to reach an agreement.
This failure reflects the same dynamic at work in the breakdown of global climate-change conferences in recent years: a few cynical countries, whose cooperation is needed to save the planet, fuel the madness of those bent on destroying it.
That will not change until a new consciousness emerges worldwide to persuade states to support binding international law.
The US has now reelected a president who understands this.
France has a president who understands the need for bold, far-reaching actions as well.
Their active leadership, and that of others, is needed now more than ever to turn the tide.
LONDON – Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has been calling for the creation of  a “League of Democracies.”
This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a “new quadrilateral security partnership” in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US. Neither Russia nor China, of course, would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8.
The League is necessary, argues McCain, because in matters vital to the US, such as fighting Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and spreading liberty, democracy, and free markets,  the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations (i.e., from Russia and China).
In other words, the League’s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs.
The most damning criticism of McCain’s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies.
This is not only dangerous, but incoherent.
Russia and China do not “threaten” the “free world” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War.
Moreover, the world’s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: it was France, after all, which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq.
Moreover, on issues like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, the US needs  Russian and Chinese help.
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
(China must learn to behave “responsibly,” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension.)  In fact, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “war against terrorism.”
Finally, the idea is impracticable.
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain’s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible.
Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition, to which Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, often gave eloquent expression: democracies don’t fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, wars would stop.
Presumably, McCain’s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant’s dream of perpetual peace  closer to realization by putting  pressure on non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary.
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The affirmative answer  seems to depend on two separate claims.
The first is that democracies have, as a matter of historical record, never fought each other.
This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II.
Moroever, they are “our kind” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems, not “Islamic democracies” like Iran.
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other.”
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy?
Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm?       
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
Members accept the obligation not  to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council.
The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN. But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including by the US.
By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war.
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism.
It is called trade.
In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules.
It is full of faults, which need to be corrected. But we don’t need a League of Democracies to do this.
By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to retard the growth of trade, and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up.
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy!
This is the thrust of McCain’s message.
As he put it, the US was built for a purpose – to serve “eternal and universal principles.”
Its God-given task is to build an “enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity, and hope.”
Noble rhetoric!
But if that is the League’s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace. This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image.
I am all for spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more warlike.
Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective, and one to which all the world’s major powers can sign up.
REYKJAVIK – If African countries were to adopt only one policy to boost economic growth and improve macroeconomic stability, they should reduce the number of currencies in circulation across the continent as quickly as possible.
Doing so would most likely encourage trade, as happened in Europe with the arrival of the euro, and could help contain inflation – which is always good for growth – by imposing international discipline on monetary policy.
The African Union is now aiming at pooling all the continent’s currencies into a single currency by 2028.
In the meantime, several regional monetary unions are on the drawing board, in addition to the two monetary unions that already exist, onede jure and the otherde facto.
The premier and oldest of these unions is composed of the fourteen countries that belong to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which both use the CFA franc.
The second of these unions is composed of Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, and now Zimbabwe, all of which use the South African rand.
Disregarding Zimbabwe, a recent and incomplete convert, the 18 countries of the two existing monetary unions have, as intended, benefited from lower inflation than much of the rest of Africa.
To see why, consider Nigeria.
Before independence, Nigeria’s legal tender was the British pound.
With the establishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria in 1959, the Nigerian pound was introduced.
Back then, one Nigerian pound was equivalent to one British pound.
This arrangement remained intact until 1973, when Nigeria adopted a new currency, the naira.
The exchange rate remained unchanged: one naira was equivalent to one British pound.
The naira was intended to bolster the country‘s independence by making it possible for the central bank to pursue its own monetary policy.
It was also a matter of national pride.
The thinking behind the new arrangement was that an independent and flexible monetary policy would serve the nation‘s interest better than a fixed exchange rate that tied the naira to the pound.
But the naira’s introduction quickly put an end to parity with the British pound.
Government expenditure exceeded federal revenue, despite rapidly rising foreign-exchange earnings from oil exports after 1970.
The federal government’s budget deficits were financed through foreign and domestic borrowing, and by printing money, which led to inflation and depreciation of the new currency.
Today, it costs 220 naira to buy one British pound, which implies 15% annual average depreciation since 1973.
This depreciation would perhaps be justifiable had Nigeria managed to use easy money to narrow the gap between ordinary Nigerians’ standard of living and that of people living in Britain. But that did not happen.
The purchasing power of national income per person in Nigeria is now 50% lower relative to Britain than in 1980.
In view of this experience, Nigeria now plans to abolish the naira in favor of joining a monetary union with four or five other West African countries (The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and perhaps Liberia). But that planned monetary union, until recently envisaged to be launched in 2009, has now been put on ice.
Why?
The smallest countries show no signs of fear of being swamped by Nigeria, by far the most populous country in the group (accounting for 155 million of the six countries’ 200 million people), especially as the new West African Central Bank is to be located in Accra, the capital of Ghana (24 million).
Others, though, may fear the dilution of their sovereignty when the new Central Bank of theWest African Monetary Zonetakes over some of the policymaking responsibilities of national central banks. But that, of course, is the chief purpose of a monetary union.
When the West African Monetary Zone finally is established, the number of currencies in Africa will equal about half the number of countries. And when the East African Community with its five members (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda) re-emerges as scheduled, the number of currencies will be reduced by another four.
The belief that sovereign national currencies, by enabling independent and flexible monetary policies, are the best way to foster economic and social development – the vision of Nigeria’s post-colonial leaders – is gradually falling by the wayside.
Efficiency dictates the use of fewer and larger currencies (and foreign investors, understandably wary of weak and volatile currencies, demand it).
Indeed, the success of the European Union and of the euro since its launch in 1999 has made a strong impression in Africa.Currencies, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, are like democracies: the best way to preserve their integrity is to share them.
BRUSSELS – Is the eurozone stepping back from the brink?
This might just be possible, because the emerging outlines of a new framework to resolve the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis contain a key component that was missing so far.
Indeed, that component’s absence was behind this summer’s spreading financial crisis, which moved beyond small, peripheral countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal to strike systemically important countries like Italy and Spain.
The starting point of the contagion was investors’ realization that Europe’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, was designed to provide emergency financial support only to the peripheral countries.
It simply does not and will never have enough funds to undertake the massive bond purchases required to stabilize the debt markets of large economies such as Spain and Italy. The EFSF will have at most €440 billion at its disposal (any increase would endanger France’s AAA rating), while the combined public debt of Italy and Spain is more than €2 trillion.
In early August, the domino effect of the eurozone periphery’s sovereign-debt crisis started to kick in, because financial markets do not wait for country after country to be downgraded.
Instead, they tend to anticipate the endgame, or at least one potential scenario, namely the unraveling of the entire crisis-containment structure.
Markets noticed that the euro seemed caught between a rock (the EFSF’s limited borrowing capacity) and a hard place (the European Central Bank’s great reluctance to engage in large-scale purchases of financially troubled governments’ bonds).
It later turned out that the ECB was not that hard after all, though it emphasized that it would stop intervening as soon as the new EFSF became operational.
And, given the EFSF’s limited firepower, the market would have been left without support.
To state the problem more generally, the eurozone requires a liquidity backstop for its fiscal authority.
In a “normal” economy with its own currency, the fiscal authorities can never face a liquidity shortage, because the government can always rely, at least potentially, on support from the central bank.
A eurozone government, by contrast, is always in a precarious situation: it has only very long-term assets (its taxing power) and shorter-term liabilities, namely government debt, much of which has to be rolled over annually.
If investors refuse to buy the debt on any terms, even a fiscally prudent government could find itself in a liquidity squeeze and become insolvent.
Similarly, banks have short-term liabilities (deposits) and long-term assets, which they cannot liquidate quickly without incurring great losses.
This is why all countries provide emergency liquidity support when a bank run materializes, as was done on a global scale when confidence in the banking sector collapsed alongside Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Likewise, the eurozone needs a mechanism to confront runs on its member countries’ government debt.
This requires that fiscal authorities have access to a large pool of liquidity in an emergency.
Only the ECB can provide this insurance.
The good news is that a solution is now slowly taking shape that promises to create a mechanism by which the ECB could backstop the EFSF.
This could be achieved simply by registering the EFSF as a bank, which would give it access to normal ECB refinancing on the same terms as other normal banks.
The EFSF could then conduct very large purchases of government debt by levering up its limited capital through ECB refinancing, using the government bonds it is buying as collateral.
In this way, the proper division of labor could be established.
The EFSF would be responsible for dealing with fiscal crises in member states.
For countries with solvency problems, an adjustment program like those for Greece, Ireland, or Portugal would be appropriate.
But, for large countries facing a liquidity shortage, the EFSF could rely on support from the ECB. 
If investors know that a liquidity squeeze is no longer possible, they will refrain from speculative attacks on solvent countries.
The near-panic conditions in financial markets eased as soon as rumors spread that this solution had at least been discussed behind closed doors.
It now needs to be implemented.
As always in Europe, there are legal and political obstacles to change.
But even the most reluctant policymakers recognize that the cost of inaction is too great.
The legal obstacles to potential “monetary financing” of the public sector in the European Union’s governing treaties can be overcome.
The more important obstacle is Germany’s reluctance to admit publicly that ECB liquidity support for government debt markets can be crucial in maintaining financial stability.
Only the German government and the ECB can open the door to this subtle but profound reform of the euro’s fundamental underpinnings.
It is a choice that they cannot put off much longer.
NEW YORK – The countries known collectively as the PIIGS – Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain – are burdened with increasingly unsustainable levels of public and private debt.   Several of the worst-hit – Portugal, Ireland, and Greece – have seen their borrowing costs soar to record highs in recent weeks, even after their loss of market access led to bailouts financed by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
Spanish borrowing costs are also rising.
Greece is clearly insolvent.
Even with a draconian austerity package, totaling 10% of GDP, its public debt would rise to 160% of GDP.
Portugal – where growth has been stagnant for a decade – is experiencing a slow-motion fiscal train wreck that will lead to public-sector insolvency.
In Ireland and Spain, transferring the banking system’s huge losses to the government’s balance sheet – on top of already-escalating public debt – will eventually lead to sovereign insolvency.
The official approach, Plan A, has been to pretend that these economies suffer a liquidity crunch, not a solvency problem, and that the provision of bailout loans – together with fiscal austerity and structural reforms – can restore debt sustainability and market access.
This “extend and pretend” or “lend and pray” approach is bound to fail, because, unfortunately, most of the options that indebted countries have used in the past to extricate themselves from excessive debt are not feasible.
For example, the time-honored solution of printing money and escaping debt via inflation is unavailable to the PIIGS, because they are trapped in the eurozone straitjacket.
The only institution that can crank up the printing press – the European Central Bank – will never resort to monetization of fiscal deficits.
Nor can we expect rapid GDP growth to save these countries.
The PIIGS’ debt burden is so high that robust economic performance is next to impossible.
Moreover, whatever economic growth some of these countries might eventually register is contingent on enacting politically unpopular reforms that will work only in the long run – and at the cost of even more short-term pain.
To restore growth, these countries must also regain competitiveness by achieving a real depreciation of their currency, thus turning trade deficits into surpluses. But a rising euro – pushed higher by excessively early monetary tightening by the ECB – implies more real appreciation, further undermining competitiveness.
The German solution to this conundrum – keeping wage growth below that of productivity, thereby reducing unit labor costs – took more than a decade to yield results.
If the PIIGS started that process today, the benefits would be too long in coming to restore competitiveness and growth.
The last option – deflation of wages and prices – to reduce costs, achieve a real depreciation, and restore competitiveness is associated with ever-deepening recession.
The real depreciation necessary to restore external balance would drive the real value of euro debts even higher, making them even more unsustainable.
Lowering private and public consumption in order to boost private savings, and implementing fiscal austerity to reduce private and public debts, aren’t options, either.
The private sector can spend less and save more, but this would entail an immediate cost known as Keynes’ paradox of thrift: declining economic output and rising debt as a share of GDP.
Recent studies by the IMF and others suggest that raising taxes, cutting subsidies, and reducing government spending – even inefficient spending – would stifle growth in the short term, exacerbating the underlying debt problem.
If the PIIGS can’t inflate, grow, devalue, or save their way out of their problems, Plan A is either failing or is bound to fail.
The only alternative is to shift quickly to Plan B – an orderly restructuring and reduction of the debts of these countries’ governments, households, and banks.
This can happen in a number of ways.
One can carry out an orderly rescheduling of the PIIGS’ public debts without actually reducing the principal amount owed. This means extending the maturity dates of debts and reducing the interest rate on the new debt to levels much lower than currently unsustainable market rates.
This solution limits the risk of contagion and the potential losses that financial institutions would bear if the value of debt principal were reduced.
Policymakers should also consider innovations used to help debt-burdened developing countries in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
For example, bondholders could be encouraged to exchange existing bonds for GDP-linked bonds, which offer payouts pegged to future economic growth.
In effect, these instruments turn creditors into shareholders in a country’s economy, entitling them to a portion of its future profits while temporarily reducing its debt burden.
Reducing the face value of mortgages and providing the upside – in case home prices were to rise in the long run – to the creditor banks is another way to convert mortgage debt partly into shareholder equity.
Bank bonds could also be reduced and converted into equity, which would both avert a government takeover of banks and prevent socialization of bank losses from causing a sovereign debt crisis.
Europe cannot afford to continue throwing money at the problem and praying that growth and time will bring salvation.
No one will descend from the heavens, deus ex machina, to bail out the IMF or the EU.
The creditors and bondholders who lent the money in the first place must carry their share of the burden, for the sake of the PIIGS, the EU, and their own bottom lines.
The widespread prescription of drugs for troubled minds has always ended badly, right back to the days of opiates and cocaine, up through bromides, barbiturates, and tranquilizers: all proved to be highly addictive drugs, but only after years of denial did doctors admit that this was so.
Now anti-depressants--global brands with household names--are the problem.
The past decade has seen a three-fold increase in prescriptions.
In England, prescriptions of anti-depressants now match Valium at its peak in 1979.
It is now clear that today's anti-depressants are not the wonder drugs they were touted as being.
The sometimes intolerable withdrawal symptoms that can make it difficult and hazardous to stop taking anti-depressants also expose many users to severe and depressing side effects: substantial weight gain, loss of libido, and mood changes, to name just the most common complaints.
Suspicions about such problems--especially about drug-induced suicidal behavior and sensitization to depression--have been rumbling for years, but searching scientific investigations have only just begun.
An important inquiry set up by the United Kingdom's drug regulators in mid-2003 will soon report its findings.
They will no doubt be presented mainly as recommendations for small-print changes in the warnings on drug labels and in the instructions for the drug's use.
This may help, it but won't address the real issue: how could regulators have allowed this problem to recur after so much bitter experience, and why should they now be allowed to investigate themselves?
On the Richter scale of drug disasters, the looming anti-depressant crisis appears to range between 7 and 11, where thalidomide rates a 10.
Time will tell, but the key point is this: the thalidomide disaster of the 1950's and 1960's happened because there was no independent control of drug safety, whereas the anti-depressant crisis has grown under theaegisof an elaborate, expensive, and global regulatory system.
The nub of the anti-depressant crisis is not that these drugs could do so much harm, but that they were allowed to do so when the precedents were so plain.
If and when this crisis is ever properly investigated, it will not so much open a can of pharmacological worms, as expose questions about what medicine is and should be.
These underlying issues seem all the more important because the Internet has for several years been groaning with evidence of the crisis to come.
The explosive growth of the Internet introduced completely new opportunities for gathering, presenting, and communicating evidence.
It broadened and deepened understanding of the problems associated with anti-depressants, giving patients a collective voice, as never before.
Previously, drug safety monitoring relied on occasional adverse reports from health professionals about patients' reaction to medicines.
But this crisis revealed these reports' fundamental inadequacies, such that users' experiences with drugs can never credibly be ignored again.
United by the Internet, many thousands of patients from all over the world began to describe experiences with anti-depressant drugs and problems brought on by withdrawal that bore little resemblance to the labels' warnings.
The impact of this user intelligence has been profound: in 2003, one pharmaceutical company revised its 2002 estimate of the incidence of withdrawal reactions from 0.2% to 25% (even as the manufacturer of a similar drug continues to claim that it is "not habit forming" at all).
The anti-depressant crisis provides, for the first time, dramatic evidence of the collective value of user reports in understanding drug risk.
To be sure, user reports are not "scientific" and most, individually, might seem naïve, confused, exaggerated, mistaken, and/or just plain self-absorbed.
Yet in this case they provided, collectively, more reliable evidence than that reported in numerous controlled clinical trials.
So, now the question is not so much the value of patients' reports, but the integrity of medical research and the state of science.
"Just how tainted has clinical medicine become," asked an editorial in the British medical journalThe Lancet in 2002; the answer was "heavily and damagingly so."
The duplicity surrounding the marketing of anti-depressant drugs underscores just how corrupt the profession has become.
The crisis now unfolding raises broad issues concerning democracy and science, the relationship between risk and benefit, and the conflict between imperatives of trade and health. But one feature above all others captures the underlying problem: the yawning gap between the words of patients who speak their minds and the terminology of producers, experts, and authorities who mince words.
The 1990's saw "depression" formally redefined as a serotonin-deficiency disease and the scourge of millions--a convenient and seductive view, but deeply simplistic.
The term "drug dependence" was also redefined, to propose that loss of personal autonomy could never arise in a therapeutic setting.
The ubiquitous term "discontinuation symptoms"--Orwelliannewspeak for withdrawal--implied that anti-depressants carried no risk of dependence.
On the contrary, wishful thinking led experts to adduce "discontinuation symptoms" as evidence of the effectiveness of vital remedies.
Later, suicides became routinely described as "non-accidental overdoses," and the broad-spectrum term "emotional lability" came into vogue, despite its inability to distinguish between a drug-induced suicide attempt and an outburst of tears.
By contrast, user reports of adverse reactions attempt to describe some human reality, rather than promote images that suit the vested interests involved.
In the long run, the anti-depressant crisis thus may prove to be a blessing in disguise, but only if it brings about the transparency and intellectual honesty needed to make the medical profession ultimately accountable to the people it claims to serve.
WASHINGTON, DC ­– America’s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength, that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table.
If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators.
Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector.
Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: arguments that persuade, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time.
On two fronts, Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps.
Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex, effectively at the heart of Wall Street.
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York’s state attorney general – into the US financial sector’s residential lending and related securities practices.
With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud.
More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives.
Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony, evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman, was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual, Goldman, and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies.
Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is little understood by America’s main financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and poses systemic market risk.
His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function: price discovery between buyers and sellers.
We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe.
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “financial innovation.”
Kaufman’s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago.
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, “The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all... I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders.
Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster; to be sure, they and many others are now listening.
On a third issue, the results so far are mixed.
Kaufman championed the case for making America’s biggest banks smaller, as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts.
His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment, co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown, that would have imposed a hard cap on banks’ size and leverage (debt relative to assets).
The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6.
It might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks.
Still, it has strengthened backing for another amendment, sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “dark” part of high-speed trading.
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing.
In particular, regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque, and when powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem.
Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden’s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election.
When he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief.
Let’s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector.
Kaufman’s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today’s complex, opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth.
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
PROVIDENCE, RI – During the past few years, many experts have suggested that bipolar disorder – a serious illness resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity and excess mortality – is under-recognized, particularly in patients with major depression.
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made.
The clinical implications of the failure to recognize bipolar disorder in depressed patients include the under-prescription of mood-stabilizing medications, and an increased risk of rapid “cycling” – swings between manic and depressive phases.
But, perhaps as a consequence of concerted efforts to improve the recognition of bipolar disorder, during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon – over-diagnosis.
In my own practice, my colleagues and I have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, despite lacking a history of manic or hypomanic episodes.
To be sure, we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder.
However, there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis.
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed.
Seven hundred psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked whether they had been previously diagnosed by a health-care professional with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives.
Slightly more than 20% (145 patients) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, significantly higher than the 12.9% rate based on the SCID.
Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID.
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID.
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID.
Our findings, validated by family history, thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed.
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview.
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis.
The question, then, is not whethersome patients previously given a diagnosis do not seem to have it upon re-interview, but ratherhow many.
How high the percentage should be before claiming over-diagnosis is a significant problem and a value judgment. But we think that an over-diagnosis rate of more than 50% crosses the clinical significance threshold.
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs.
Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice, and, depending on the medication, they can produce potentially significant health complications affecting renal, endocrine, hepatic, immunologic, or metabolic function. Thus, over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication.
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and publicity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder. Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder.
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.
This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire, but rather how these scales are used.
Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity, at a cost of false positives, because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation. But insufficient diagnostic rigor can result in over-diagnosis.
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating.
We believe that the increased availability of medications that have been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder might be influencing clinicians who are unsure whether or not a patient has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to err on the side of diagnosing the disorder that is responsive to medication.
This bias is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians, which has emphasized research on delayed diagnosis and under-recognition of bipolar disorder, possibly sensitizing clinicians accordingly.
The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious, agitated, and/or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and “racing thoughts” being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder.
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder, along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis, it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis.
Both can have negative consequences. While there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach, we recommend that clinicians use a standardized, validated method.
ROME – US President Barack Obama’s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe’s division, can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings.
The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world.
The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe’s peace, stability, and economic growth.
The continent’s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner. And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States.
Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries.
They also spring from different factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation.
Europe’s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
Proposals for some sort of “partnership for transformation,” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, should bear in mind that the region’s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months.
No surprise, then, that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans.
Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism, and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated.
Given this, the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region’s security.
Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe’s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability, the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs.
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage.
The broad planks of a partnership are already there, so what is now needed is to enhance Europe’s integration with its southern neighbors.
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU “Plan for the Mediterranean” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources.
The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services.
Let us, together with the US, tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies.
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU’s internal market and participate in EU programs.
To achieve all of this, a clear set of principles is required.
We Europeans must favor stability, create a real spirit of co-ownership, and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period.
Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms.
Moreover, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task.
One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank’s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa, with shares held by the region’s governments (or other institutions) and other willing parties.
The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises.
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe; there’s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
At the same time, the EU must launch a “dialogue among equals” on political and security matters, aimed at confidence-building across the region.
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability.
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “mare nostrum.”
They are part of our collective history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build.
TOLEDO, SPAIN – This autumn, the Toledo International Centre for Peace convened a meeting devoted to water cooperation in the Middle East.
One conclusion that emerged was that any effective response to the unequal distribution of natural resources in the region must be regional.
With this idea in mind, Munther Haddadin, a former Jordanian minister of water resources, proposed for the Middle East a “Water and Energy Union,” a long-term mechanism to integrate a fragmented region.
The idea is compelling.
Attending to such basic needs in a way that manages scarcities and surpluses regionally has a powerful logic.
Indeed, the parallels with the role of coal and steel in forging the European Union are clear enough that, over the past month, Joschka Fischer, Germany’s former foreign minister, has called for such a union.
So, too, have former Czech president Václav Havel and a group of global luminaries who support the idea of regional integration through water.
Having convened the meeting in Spain, we are very much in favor of the pursuit of such a worthy goal.
But the European “coal and steel union” became possible only after Europe’s major political conflicts were resolved.
A successful process of regional integration in the Middle East will also require a political framework that ensures the stability needed to make regional cooperation work.
All sides need to know where their borders begin and end. And past injustices will need to be put aside, so that the cycle of revenge and the automatic reflex in favor of immediate gain do not scuttle regional solutions to problems.
Here, the experience of a previous regional exercise is worth acknowledging.
During the 1990’s, the multilateral track of the Middle East Peace Process pursued regional coordination concerning economic development, the environment, refugees, arms control, and water.
It failed, because when the bilateral talks collapsed, readiness to engage in regional cooperation withered under the despair of failed politics and the bloody reality of the Second Intifada.
The necessary political framework also needs to be regional and, fortunately, it exists.
The Arab Peace Initiative, first tabled at an Arab League Summit in Beirut in 2002 and reconfirmed in Riyadh in 2007, provides all the parties with a framework to resolve their differences, as well as a political basis for moving forward.
Adopting it is essential to moving forward, especially if additional chapters addressing regional security and economic relations are included.
Despite today’s chronic pessimism, the pursuit of a Middle East Water and Energy Union, coupled with adoption of the Arab Peace Initiative, would change mindsets.
Together, they would form a mutually reinforcing process: a political agreement would provide the framework in which the region’s water and energy needs can be met; and meeting these basic needs in an effective and innovative way would make the Arab Peace Initiative more than a paper deal.
Moreover, the arid triangle formed by Israel, Palestine, and Jordan cannot meet its water needs unless yet another dimension is incorporated into the solution.
A World Bank report has already stated that, with 19 million people living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean by 2020, water needs would not be met without making existing technologies of desalinization more economically viable.
Coincidentally, over the past month, there have been early signals of greater interest in a regional political approach.
The Bahraini foreign minister recently called for a regional forum that includes Israel to resolve the problems ahead; a former senior Saudi official met with Israelis in the United Kingdom to reiterate the need for a comprehensive peace agreement; and Israeli Labor Party leader Ehud Barak has said that it may be time to pursue an overall peace deal for the region, accompanied by an economic package, since separate negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians may prove fruitless.
Despite decades of effort, the process of trial and error through bilateral and conflict-management approaches has always ended in frustration.
Whatever economic projects have been launched has crumbled in the face of the persistence of the occupation.
The problems are too complex, and the dangers of radicalism too advanced, to permit success through haphazard means.
The Middle East can end its state of permanent crisis only if it builds a comprehensive foundation for peace.
The Arab Peace Initiative, combined with the long-term development of a Water and Energy Union, offers the necessary basis to meet the needs of the region’s peoples and mitigate future conflict.
The Middle East must no longer be a hallmark of intractable violence.
It can be a herald of innovation on issues of common human concern – water, energy, and politics.
BEIJING – In March, at a meeting in Beijing organized by Columbia University’s Initiative for Policy Dialogue and China’s Central University of Finance and Economics, scholars and policymakers discussed how to reform the international monetary system.
After all, even if the system did not directly cause the recent imbalances and instability in the global economy, it proved ineffective in addressing them.
Reform will, of course, require extensive discussion and deliberation.
But the consensus in Beijing was that the G-20 should adopt a modest proposal this year: a limited expansion of the International Monetary Fund’s current system of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).
This proposal, while limited in scope, could play an important role in initiating discussion of deeper reforms while helping to restore the fragile world economy to health and achieve the aim expressed in the G-20’s Pittsburgh declaration: strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.
We suggest that SDRs’ role be expanded through new issues and by increasing their use in IMF lending.
Doing so would build on the enlightened suggestion made at the G-20’s London meeting in April 2009 to issue SDRs equivalent to $250 billion, which was then quickly implemented.
The G-20 could suggest that the IMF issue a significant volume of SDRs over the next three years.
We would suggest, for example, an issue of SDR150-250 billion annually (approximately $240-390 billion at current exchange rates).
Such a measure would have several positive effects.
First, it would reduce the recessionary bias in the world economy, especially during crises and in their aftermath.
Many countries continue to accumulate high levels of precautionary reserves, especially to avoid future crises stemming from reversals on their capital and trade accounts.
Recent financial crises have taught countries that those with large reserves are better able to weather the vicissitudes of international financial markets.
While such reserve accumulations help protect countries, in certain periods they reduce global aggregate demand.
Given its relatively small scale, the annual issue of SDRs would only partly offset these deficiencies, but it would nonetheless help sustain and accelerate global recovery without causing inflationary pressure.
Moreover, reducing the need for countries to set aside funds for reserves would also facilitate some reduction of global imbalances.
Ideally, additional issuance of SDRs would be accompanied by further measures to increase their effectiveness.
For example, countries’ unused SDRs could be held as “deposits” by the IMF, which the Fund could then use to finance its lending programs.
This should be understood as the first step toward integrating “general resource” and “SDR” accounts into a single IMF account, and to increase the SDR’s role in IMF transactions so that it eventually becomes the main – or even only – mechanism for IMF financing.
During a declared crisis, IMF lending should be financed entirely by new SDR issues in unlimited amounts.
A working group could be established to study other reforms that would enhance global financial stability further and address other global economic and financial objectives.
For example, alternative systems of SDR allocation, with a greater proportion of SDRs given to countries actually demanding the reserves (mainly developing countries), might contribute to global growth and stability.
One advantage of this modest proposal is that it would not prejudice the outcomes of the working group on broader reforms, like new distribution formulas for SDRs.
The issuance of additional SDRs, while contributing to global stability today, would not alter in any fundamental way existing monetary arrangements.
We suggest that this proposal be discussed at forthcoming meetings of the G20.
The G-20 showed its effectiveness in responding to the crisis that erupted in 2008.
The question today is whether, with the moment of crisis passing and countries’ circumstances and perspectives diverging, the G-20 can demonstrate the leadership the world needs in addressing its ongoing critical problems.
A failure to take concrete action would risk breeding disillusionment.
Our proposal would reaffirm the G-20’s continued leadership in ensuring greater stability and sustained growth in the world economy.
WARSAW – The eurozone is often considered an experiment – a monetary union without political unification.
Those who make this claim seem to have in mind a model of a single state, which possesses two relevant features: limited fiscal sovereignty for regional and local governments and a substantial common budget from which regions hit by asymmetric shocks can receive transfers.
Those who claim that “political union” is necessary for the eurozone appear to focus on the second feature, despite the fact that fiscal constraints on local governments are clearly a typical and important component of single states.
In this sense, they ignore the fact that the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact has been in principle an important component of political union, not its substitute.
Indeed, the eurozone’s current fiscal problems do not result from the lack of a large common budget, but from weak enforcement of the Pact.
More fundamentally, monetary unions – in a broader sense – have existed not only within single states, but also in groups of sovereign states, the gold standard being the most notable example in history.
The experience of such monetary unions offers two lessons.
First, they required fiscal discipline in the member states, which was true under the gold standard, with its informal norm of balanced budgets.
Second, they existed without any fiscal transfers from a common center, because such a center did not exist.
Instead, a great deal of flexibility, including within their labor markets, facilitated adjustment to asymmetric shocks.
It is clear that there is no scope in the foreseeable future to extend the EU budget in order to increase fiscal transfers to eurozone members affected by sharp declines in consumption.
This would require an enhanced level of European identity, something which the Union’s political elites cannot generate artificially. &#160;But the crucial point is not that a large common budget in the eurozone is politically impossible to achieve, but rather that it would not address the main problem: the weakness of the mechanisms safeguarding fiscal discipline in the member states.
Instead of looking at the wrong model – that of a single state – the EU and its member states should focus on the conditions required for the proper functioning of a currency union that has no common budget to compensate for asymmetric shocks.
First, utmost priority should be given to strengthening the mechanisms aimed at preventing pro-cyclical policies and large fiscal shocks.
This requires ensuring the credibility and transparency of the accounting rules that define budget deficits and public debt, with closer monitoring also focusing on the development of asset bubbles, which cause deep recessions – and thus sharp increases in budget deficits – when they burst.
Likewise, the European Central Bank’s monetary policy should “lean against the wind” by paying more attention to the development of asset bubbles.
As the ECB’s common monetary policy cannot fit the macroeconomic conditions of all the member countries, the eurozone countries need macro-prudential regulations that aim at reducing excessive credit growth.
Meanwhile, the Stability and Growth Pact should be strictly enforced, which implies using and strengthening the available sanctions.
To be sure, initiatives at the EU and/or eurozone level cannot substitute for stronger mechanisms of discipline in the member states, which are ultimately the responsibility of national politicians and publics.
But EU-wide measures aimed at ensuring discipline are necessary to spur the growth of preventive mechanisms in the member states, and such initiatives are largely dependent on the large countries, which thus bear a special responsibility for the developments within the eurozone – and within the EU.
Second, beyond strengthening economic institutions, EU countries must accelerate structural reforms to boost their long-run growth prospects and facilitate their smooth adjustment to shocks.
The former are necessary to help Union members grow out of their increased public debt, while the latter would help them to address unemployment.
Of the many necessary measures in this area, the most important include a vigorous effort to complete the Single Market, coupled with avoidance of economic nationalism at all costs.
Moreover, the Lisbon Agenda should be reinvigorated, with a focus on market reforms, and the EU should urgently reconsider measures – particularly regarding climate policy and the drift toward an EU-wide social policy – that risk imposing additional burdens on their economies and/or hamper the flexibility of markets.
In this respect, the mode of fiscal reforms is fundamentally important.
As EU members already have large tax burdens, further tax increases would weaken the forces of growth.
Thus, fiscal reform should focus on reducing the growth of spending commitments, which –given the aging of EU societies – must include raising the retirement age.
Finally, rigid labor markets and, more generally, regulatory constraints on prices and on the supply response of the economy, deepen recessionary reactions to various shocks, and contribute to the growth of unemployment.
Therefore, labor-market liberalization should be a high priority and another area of focus for the reinvigorated Lisbon Agenda.
European elites are fond of exclamations about “European solidarity,” “social cohesion,” and the “European social model.”
But no amount of lofty rhetoric can substitute for the reforms outlined here – or obviate the need for them.
LONDON – There was a time when league tables were to be found only on the sports pages of newspapers.
Now they are a global obsession.
There are school and university league tables, rankings of companies on profitability or corporate social responsibility, tables of happiness indicators by country, and tables that attempt to rank consumer brands by value.
There is even a league table of the world’s funniest jokes (I did not laugh much).
The financial world is also full of such rankings.
Investment bankers wait with bated breath for the merger and acquisition league tables, even though the link between a high ranking and profitability is somewhere between loose and non-existent.
Bank league tables have been with us for a while, and now tend to be based on capital strength, rather than asset volume, which is an improvement of sorts, but still not very meaningful.
There are also now several different league tables – which are generating considerable angst – that rank financial centers based largely on surveys of firms.
How badly the financial crisis damaged the reputation and performance of the major Western centers is a question increasingly asked in London, and to a lesser extent in New York.
(Some Americans tend to think that the world will beat a path to their door, no matter how badly they are received when they arrive!)
So far, the message from the most recent tables is not too alarming for the incumbents.
A ranking prepared for the City Corporation in London shows New York and London still neck and neck at the top of the league.
The Banker magazine produces another, with New York on top and London a close second – though the distance between them and their pursuers is narrowing.
The scores in both London and New York for the quality and intensity of regulation, and the tax burden, have dropped.
Firms seem nervous about the future in both areas. 
The most striking change in the rankings is the rise of major Asian financial centers – and not just Hong Kong and Singapore, but also Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen.
The Chinese have been explicitly promoting their financial centers, and the impact is beginning to be seen.
The World Economic Forum’s Financial Development Index – yet another league table to consider – shows Hong Kong and Singapore very close indeed to London, with China now ahead of Italy on the overall measure of financial sophistication.
Noodles are beating spaghetti.
Some of this is unsurprising.
As the world’s center of economic gravity shifts east, the balance of financial activity is bound to move with it.
On the principle that if something is inevitable, it is wise to welcome it, the appropriate response in London and New York is to find ways of collaborating with these new centers.
But the more important question for the traditional financial centers is whether international activity that can move really is moving.
That is far harder to judge.
There are anecdotes about individual hedge-fund managers moving to Geneva.
Every time a government, or a regulator, announces some new control, or a tightening of existing controls, there are threats from bankers that they will pack up and leave town, taking their Porsches and mistresses with them. 
These threats, which used to have a lot of political impact, are now much less effective.
Some politicians and commentators quickly say, “Good riddance.”
Even the Bank of England has asked whether, given the cost of mopping up the mess caused by the latest crisis, it is worth playing host to a global financial market.
This is risky speculation.
However badly bankers have behaved – and some clearly deserve a decade or more in the sin bin – financial services are a crucial element of London’s economy.
If the financial sector declines, what will replace it in employment terms?
Airy talk about science and manufacturing as ladders out of recession (a favorite image of former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown) is just that – empty words.
There are few, if any, examples of high-cost post-industrial societies reviving their manufacturing sector on a large scale once it has declined.
London, in particular, has no inalienable right to be a global financial center.
The United Kingdom’s domestic market is, after all, much smaller than that of the United States.
Indeed, the location of financial activity has changed through the centuries.
If incumbency were a permanent advantage, Goldman Sachs’ global headquarters would be in Babylon.
There must be a tipping point at which some combination of higher taxation, more burdensome regulation, and a hostile political climate causes financial firms to relocate. 
There is a risk that Britain may now be approaching that point.
That is why the UK’s Financial Services Authority, and even the Confederation of British Industry, which speaks largely for non-financial firms concerned about access to credit, has begun to call for a truce between the authorities and financial markets.
The next two or three months will determine whether peace breaks out, and, if it does, whether it will endure.
As is always the case in peace negotiations, both sides must be willing to compromise.
Firms will need to show visible restraint when it comes to this year’s bonus round.
The British government will not tolerate another jamboree.
And governments on both sides of the Atlantic will need to decide just how far they want to go in punishing banks.
Continued threats of ever-higher tax burdens could prove dangerously counterproductive.
If we fail to settle on a new social contract between the state and the markets soon, those markets may indeed move elsewhere.
It is time to end the fiction that Vladimir Putin’s “dictatorship of law” has made postcommunist Russia any less lawless.
The murder of Anna Politkovskaya, one of Russia’s bravest and best journalists, a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, is final proof that President Putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law.
This recognition is a timely one for the world to make, particularly Europe.
Germany’s Foreign Ministry is preparing a policy on Russian/German relations that will enshrine indifference to Putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the European Union.
But indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages Putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena, as in his current campaign to strangle Georgia’s economy.
The killing of Politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense ofdéjà vu: just as in the KGB’s heyday, people simply disappear in Putin’s Russia.
Politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks.
Enver Ziganshin, the chief engineer of BP Russia, was shot to death in Irkutsk on September 30.
Andrei Kozlov, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud, was assassinated on September 14.
The fact that Russia’s Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, took over the investigation into Politkovskaya’s killing, as he did with the murder of Kozlov, doesn’t inspire hope, as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy.
In fact, the involvement of the highest level of Russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found.
Politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of Russia’s President.
In her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in Moscow,Novaya Gazeta, and in her books “Putin's Russia: Life in a Failing Democracy” and “A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya,” Politkovskaya wrote of the vanishing freedoms that are the signature characteristic of Putin’s presidency.
As shown by the exile of the former media tycoons Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinky, and the imprisonment of oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, three fates await Putin’s enemies: exile, imprisonment, or the grave.
I am not accusing Putin’s government of the contract killing of Politkovskaya.
After all, as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides Putin, not least of which is the current Chechen Prime Minister, Ramzan Kadyrov, whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom.
But even if Vladimir Putin’s associates had nothing to do with Politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of Moscow, his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out.
Like the murder of Archbishop Thomas Beckett in his Canterbury Cathedral many centuries ago, the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king.
Given what Politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the Kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her.
Putin’s Russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years.
None of those crimes has been solved, which would not be the case if Putin’s “dictatorship of law” was anything more than a PR strategy.
The six year period since Vladimir Putin arrived in the Kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals.
On one hand, the world sees a young, educated leader pledging to modernize Russia, particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms.
On the other, the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in Russia's FSB security service (the former KGB) provide no security to those murdered, and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists, scientists, and environmental activists.
These “neo-spies” include journalist Gregory Pasko, arms control expert Igor Sutyagin, diplomat Valentin Moiseyev, physicist Valentin Danilov, and others.
The supposedly civilizing influence of being a Western partner — chairing a G-8 summit in Saint Petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on Putin’s Kremlin cabal.
Once again exposure to Western values has delivered another Potemkin Village; Russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions, but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule.
The danger for the world is that Putin’s lawlessness is being exported.
Across Russia’s near abroad, a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root.
Look at Putin’s attempt to rig Ukraine’s previous presidential election, and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Look at the rogue breakaway regions in Moldova and Georgia that exist only because of the Kremlin’s backing.
Look at how the Kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies.
Every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior, criminals grow bolder.
It is past time for the world to recognize Vladimir Putin for what he is: a man who is taking Russia back into the shadows.
So the world must now ponder that old Latin maximqui tacet consenterevidetur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to Putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower.
The editorial published in the Colombian newspaperDiario del Sur on July 6 (“A Slap in the Face of Violence”) was ecstatic: “Never before, in spite of the violence that has oppressed us during so many years, has Colombia lived a day like yesterday: historic and unforgettable in every aspect.”
At noon on July 5, Colombians throughout the country poured into the streets to show their outrage at the news that 11 provincial politicians had been killed while being held by leftist rebels.
A human chain was formed, with participants wearing white tops.
My colleagues in the capital, Bogotá, and in the south of the country, where we have humanitarian projects, say that everyone was waving white scarves.
White balloons were launched everywhere.
Press agencies estimate that, with more than one million participants, this was the largest public protest since October 1999, which was also – sadly – a demonstration against violence and kidnappings.
But, while the killing of the 11 congressmen from Cali region – attributed to “crossfire’” during an attack by an “unidentified military group”the leftist rebels – provoked shock and anger, there was no agreement on how to solve the chronic problem of “El Secuestro” (The Kidnapping).
Some Colombians demand a “humanitarian accord” – an exchange of prisoners for hostages – and reject “blood and fire” rescue attempts.
Others oppose “ceding the territory” (setting up a demilitarized zone, where any such exchange could take place) and demand of the government “firmeza, siempre firmeza!” (to be “firm” and go after the rebels).
As is often the case in armed conflicts, civilians suffer the most.
The July 5 protest reminded us of the 3,000 kidnappings since the start of this four-decade conflict, but Colombians could form human chains and release white balloons for many other reasons.
Consider, for example, Colombia’s grim ranking as global leader in the number of victims injured by landmines.
According to “Landmine Monitor 2006,” Colombia had 1,110 victims last year, followed by Cambodia with 875 and Afghanistan with 848.
This unnoticed drama is emblematic of the under-reported Colombian conflict.
Indeed, if there were such a thing as a combined index of despair, Colombia would be an undisputed leader.
Hostage-taking, and killing and maiming by landmines, are but the side effects of the oldest and longest-running civil war in Latin America, which has resulted in three million internally displaced persons – one of the world’s highest levels, close to that of Sudan, Congo, and Iraq.
Even if there were, by some miracle, a negotiated end to the fighting, the scars left by this conflict will remain.
So, besides helping the country find a political solution, there is also a need to focus on long-term reconstruction and reconciliation, so that young lives distorted by the civil war can be righted and children can be rescued from the harmful influence of so much violence and bloodshed.
In Colombia’s south – where the heavy presence of illegal armed groups makes social peace a distant dream – I went to visit a secondary school, as part of a needs assessment.
After four hours on a dirt road, I reached a highlands hamlet.
The smart and friendly teenagers were eager to learn how to surf the Internet, just installed in their school.
But when I asked five of them what they would like to become, I understood that this conflict has marked them forever.
Their dream careers were: lawyer, criminal investigator, forensic physician, and soldier.
The fifth one wanted to become a chemist, so that he could set up a cocaine laboratory.
The teenagers’ plans simply reflect a sad reality: these pupils are the second generation that has not known anything but war.
On the day of the march against violence, next to the editorial inDiario del Sur was a simple, one-question opinion poll: “Do you think that the security [in our department’s capital] has improved since the beginning of the year?” Over 90% said “no.”
This is why thousands went into the streets to be counted.
It is perhaps a beginning.
NEW YORK – The past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media.
Television has reshaped society in every corner of the world.
Now an explosion of new media devices is joining the TV set: DVDs, computers, game boxes, smart phones, and more.
A growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects.
The United States led the world into the television age, and the implications can be seen most directly in America’s long love affair with what Harlan Ellison memorably called “the glass teat.”
In 1950, fewer than 8% of American households owned a TV; by 1960, 90% had one.
That level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere, and the poorest countries are still not there.
True to form, Americans became the greatest TV watchers, which is probably still true today, even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete.
The best evidence suggests that Americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount, given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices.
Other countries log far fewer viewing hours.
In Scandinavia, for example, time spent watching TV is roughly half the US average.
The consequences for American society are profound, troubling, and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded.
First, heavy TV viewing brings little pleasure.
Many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction, with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse.
Such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do.
Moreover, heavy TV viewing has contributed to social fragmentation.
Time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen.
Robert Putnam, the leading scholar of America’s declining sense of community, has found that TV viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “social capital,” the trust that binds communities together. Americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago.
Of course, many other factors are at work, but television-driven social atomization should not be understated.
Certainly, heavy TV viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health.
Americans lead the world in obesity, with roughly two-thirds of the US population now overweight.
Again, many factors underlie this, including a diet of cheap, unhealthy fried foods, but the sedentary time spent in front of the TV is an important influence as well.
At the same time, what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically.
Television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society.
America’s TV ownership is almost entirely in private hands, and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising.
Effective advertising campaigns, appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food, sex, and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society.
The same, of course, has happened to politics.
American politicians are now brand names, packaged like breakfast cereal.
Anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle.
All roads to power in America lead through TV, and all access to TV depends on big money.
This simple logic has put American politics in the hands of the rich as never before.
Even war can be rolled out as a new product.
The Bush administration promoted the premises of the Iraq war – Saddam Hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction –in the familiar colorful, fast-paced, and graphics-heavy style of television advertising.
Then the war itself began with the so-called “shock and awe” bombing of Baghdad – a made-for-TV live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the US-led invasion.
Many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of TV viewing might run even deeper than addiction, consumerism, loss of social trust, and political propaganda.
Perhaps TV is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently warned that TV viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development, and called on parents to keep children under two away from the TV and similar media.
A recent survey in the US by the organization Common Sense Media reveals a paradox, but one that is perfectly understandable.
Children in poor American households today not only watch more TV than children in wealthy households, but are also more likely to have a television in their room.
When a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises, economists call it an “inferior” good.
To be sure, the mass media can be useful as a provider of information, education, entertainment, and even political awareness.
But too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid.
At the very least, we can minimize those dangers.
Successful approaches around the world include limits on TV advertising, especially to young children; non-commercial, publicly-owned TV networks like the BBC; and free (but limited) TV time for political campaigns.
Of course, the best defense is our own self-control.
We can all leave the TV off more hours per day and spend that time reading, talking with each other, and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust.
These are violent times.
Some believe that we are experiencing a new kind of conflict: “culture wars,” such as those between Sunni and Shiite Muslims or tribal groups in Africa and Asia, or indeed Islamists and Westerners.
However, the deeper reasons for some of these conflicts may well be more traditional.
Belonging to a particular cultural group is merely a pretext for battles between the winners and losers of globalization.
Ruthless leaders mobilize disoriented followers.
Particularly the losers, often represented by young men with no future to look forward to, can be induced to take even suicidal action against the alleged enemy.
Perhaps one should not be surprised that at such a time, the oldest of our ugly ­– indeed, deadly – resentments, anti-Semitism, is re-emerging from the shadows.
Its comeback takes the classical form of attacks on individuals, like the recent killing of a young Jew in France, or of disfiguring symbolic places, like cemeteries and synagogues. But there is also a more general sense of hostility to all things Jewish.
One would have thought that anti-Semitism died forever with the Holocaust; but it did not.
There are those who deny that the Holocaust ever took place, or that it did in its all-too-well-documented manner.
The deniers range from second-rate historians like David Irving to apparently popular politicians like Iran’s recently elected president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
The evidence of what Nazi Germany did is so powerful that those who deny it can probably be dealt with even without putting them in prison and thereby drawing more attention to them than they deserve.
The more worrisome source of anti-Semitism is different and justifies speaking of a new anti-Semitism.
It has to do with Israel.
To be sure, America is the first name in anti-Western resentment. But its second name is Israel, the only successful modern country in the Middle East, which is also highly militarized, an occupying power, and ruthless in defense of its interests.
It is difficult to exaggerate the strange sentiment in the West which one might call Palestine romanticism.
Intellectuals like the late Edward Said gave voice to it, but it has many followers in the United States and Europe.
Palestine romanticism glorifies the Palestinians as the victims of Israel’s rule, points to the treatment of Israeli Palestinians as at best second-class citizens, and cites the many incidents of oppression in the occupied territories, including the effects of Israel’s “security fence.”
Implicitly or explicitly, people take the side of the victims, contribute by sending money to them, declare even suicide bombers legitimate, and move ever further away from support for and defense of Israel.
Of course, it is true that in theory one can oppose Israel’s policies without being anti-Semitic.
After all, there are enough critics of Israel’s policies among Israelis.
Yet the distinction has become more and more difficult to maintain.
Jews outside Israel feel that they have to defend – right or wrong – the country that, after all, is their ultimate hope of security.
This makes their friends hesitate to speak up for fear of being painted into not just an anti-Israel, but also an anti-Semitic corner.
The defensiveness of Jews and the uneasy silence of their friends mean that the stage of public debate is open for those who actually are anti-Semitic, though they confine themselves to anti-Israel language.
Anti-Semitism is disgusting in whatever form it arises.
This is true also for other kinds of group hatred, but the Holocaust makes anti-Semitism unique, because it is an emotion complicit in the near annihilation of an entire people.
The new anti-Semitism, however, cannot be fought successfully by education and argument in the rest of the world alone.
It is linked to Israel.
If one belongs to a generation that regarded Israel as one of the great achievements of the twentieth century, and admired the way in which the country provided a proud home for the persecuted and downtrodden, one is particularly concerned that it may now be at risk.
SEOUL – The long-delayed meeting of North Korea’s ruling Worker’s Party is now underway, and comes at a time of severe tension between North Korea and the international community.
It is widely expected that Kim Jong-il’s third son, Kim Jong-eun, will be appointed to a key position and be publicly announced as his father’s successor.
There are also hints that a reshuffling of important positions within the Party will take place, allowing the presumed heir to form a new power base.
Whatever happens, and whoever turns out to be the new leader, North Korea most likely faces an unstable future.
The cost of maintaining internal order will continue to rise as the system’s fundamental defects force the new leader to confront stark new challenges.
Moreover, responsibility for managing that potential instability extends far beyond the leadership in Pyongyang.
North Korea’s fragility is suggested by the fact that even such an important political event as the Worker’s Party conference, held for the first time in three decades, was abruptly postponed earlier in September.
One cause for the delay could be a schism within the ruling elite, a group that “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-il himself cannot control as effectively as before.
Moreover, Kim’s health problems might have worsened much faster than outsiders guess, further complicating matters.
“Enough is enough,” a mid-level North Korean government official recently uttered in a private conversation with a South Korean visitor to Pyongyang regarding Kim Jong-eun’s likely succession.
Ordinary North Koreans, too, evidently seem to view this succession differently from that of Kim Jong-il’s inheritance of power from his father, Kim Il-sung.
Moreover, there is no hope that any new leader, whoever it may be, will get any breathing space to establish unquestioned control, given the economy’s utter state of decay, as last year’s failed bid to reform the currency demonstrated.
The regime is under growing pressure from those at the bottom of North Korean society, and recognizes its own inability to handle the situation.
For example, for the first time, North Korea’s prime minister publicly apologized for a policy error – the failure of the currency redenomination.
For the dynamics of the relationship between North Korea’s people and its rulers seems to be changing fundamentally.
One troubling aspect of this change is that the new leader may feel the need to resort to brute force more frequently in order to suppress popular resistance.
And, at a time of domestic hardship and diplomatic isolation, North Korea’s leaders, their confidence boosted by their possession of nuclear weapons, might try to distract their public through audacious, and possibly destructive, acts abroad.
The attack on the South Korean naval ship Cheonan earlier this year may be a grim sign of things to come.
Indeed, the North Korean threat nowadays derives more from the regime’s internal weaknesses than from its aggressive external posture – the latter being the authorities’ fearful response to the former.
Unfortunately, however, most international efforts have sought to ameliorate the symptoms rather than cure the underlying disease.
Of course, in order to pressure North Korea’s government to give up its nuclear option, the current international economic sanctions, which target WMD-related products and luxury goods, probably should continue.
But, at the same time, the international community should place greater emphasis on policies aimed at inducing North Korea to launch serious economic reform.
At a time of increased tension between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States such a policy may seem impossible to undertake.
Yet a road map for a peaceful transition can be designed.
If, say, North Korea is willing to respect international standards of economic behavior, it could be invited to join the International Monetary Fund.
Western governments also could permit charitable foundations to provide North Korean officials or students with scholarships to study abroad and learn how to run a market economy.
Of course, any assistance to North Korea would have to be monitored closely to prevent it from being diverted for military or other political purposes.
The international community would lose nothing by trying this approach and testing the regime’s will to reform.
In fact, following the recent currency fiasco, North Korean leaders may have become more open to economic reform than ever before.
Such an approach is also compatible with Chinese policy, which has been to pressure North Korea to adopt its model of economic reform.
To be sure, North Korea’s regime is not the only obstacle to international engagement.
Conservatives in both the United States and South Korea may argue that North Korea must first move toward denuclearization before any kind of economic assistance is offered.
But there is no reason why international efforts to ensure North Korea’s denuclearization must preclude policies aimed at bringing about domestic reform.
We need not assume that these goals cannot be pursued simultaneously.
On the contrary, it may be impossible to win North Korea’s assent to denuclearization in the absence of far-reaching domestic change.  
The past two decades have shown that “politically correct” decisions do not produce the “right” results, even in the long run.
As North Korea grooms a new leader, the world needs to groom a new policy for North Korea.
NEW DELHI – Leading members of the governments of India and South Korea recently met to begin a new “strategic partnership.”
They are not alone in doing so, for across Asia, a new security architecture is being constructed, seemingly piecemeal.
How Asia’s geopolitical landscape will evolve over the coming decades is not easy to foresee.
But it is apparent that an increasingly assertive China is unwittingly reinforcing America’s role in Asia, restoring US primacy as the implicit guarantor of security and stability in the region.
There are at least four possible Asian security scenarios for the years and decades ahead.
The first is the rise of a Sino-centric Asia.
China seeks a multipolar world but a unipolar Asia.
By contrast, the US desires a unipolar world but a multipolar Asia.
A second scenario is that the US remains Asia’s principal security anchor, with or without a third possibility: the emergence of a constellation of Asian states with common interests working together to ensure that Asia is not unipolar.
Finally, Asia could come to be characterized by several resurgent powers, including Japan, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and a reunified Korea.
Of the four scenarios, the first has caused the greatest unease.
China’s neighbors are increasingly anxious about its growing power and assertiveness.
While China’s rulers aspire to shape a Sino-centric Asia, their efforts to intimidate smaller neighbors hardly make China a credible candidate for Asian leadership.
After all, genuine leadership cannot come from raw power, but only from other states’ consent or tacit acceptance.
If leadership could be built on brute force, schoolyard bullies would be class presidents.
In any event, China’s power may be vast and rapidly growing, but it lacks the ability to compel.
In other words, China does not have the capability to rout any rival militarily, let alone enforce its will on Asia.
That fact has, however, done little to allay fears in the region.
With its defense spending having grown almost twice as fast as its GDP, China is now beginning to take the gloves off, confident that it has acquired the necessary muscle.
For example, China now includes the South China Sea in its “core” national interests, on a par with Taiwan and Tibet, in order to stake a virtually exclusive claim to military operations there.
China also has increasingly questioned India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh, the northeastern Indian state that China’s rulers call “Southern Tibet” and claim largely as their own.
Indian defense officials have reported a rising number of Chinese military incursions across the 4,057-kilometer Himalayan border.
As China seeks to translate its economic clout into major geopolitical advantages in Asia, a country that once boasted of “having friends everywhere” finds that its growing power may be inspiring awe, but that its actions are spurring new concerns and fears.
Which states will accept China as Asia’s leader?
Six decades of ruthless repression has failed to win China acceptance even in Tibet and Xinjiang, as the Tibetan and Uighur revolts of 2008 and 2009 attested.
Leadership entails more than the possession of enormous economic and military power.
It demands the power of ideas that can galvanize others.
Such power also serves as the moral veneer to the assertiveness often involved in the pursuit of any particular cause or interest.
The US and its allies won the Cold War, for example, not so much by military means as by spreading the ideas of political freedom and market capitalism to other regions.
In the words of the strategic analyst Stanley A. Weiss, this “helped suck the lifeblood out of communism’s global appeal,” making it incapable of meeting the widespread yearning for a better and more open life.
China has shown itself adept at assertively promoting its national interests and playing classical balance-of-power geopolitics.
But, in order to displace the US and assume the mantle of leadership in Asia, China must do more than pursue its own interests or contain potential rivals.
Most fundamentally, what does China represent in terms of values and ideas?
In the absence of an answer to that question, China’s overly assertive policies have proven a diplomatic boon for the US in strengthening and expanding American security arrangements in Asia.
South Korea has tightened its military alliance with the US, Japan has backed away from a move to get the US to move its Marine airbase out of Okinawa, and India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, among others, have drawn closer to the US.
In terms of power-projection force capabilities or the range of military bases and security allies in Asia, no power or combination of powers is likely to match the US in the next quarter-century.
But, while America’s continued central role in Asia is safe, the long-term viability of its security arrangements boils down to the credibility of its security assurances to allies and partners.
America’s readiness to stand by them when the game gets rough will determine the strength and size of its security-alliance system in Asia in the years ahead.
The third and fourth scenarios can unfold even if the US remains the principal security anchor for Asia.
A number of Asian countries have already started building mutually beneficial security cooperation on a bilateral basis, thereby laying the groundwork for a potential web of interlocking strategic partnerships.
A constellation of Asian states linked by strategic cooperation, in fact, has become critical to help institute power stability in the region.
The United Nations is torn apart by internal tensions.
No sooner was the controversy over the creation of a Human Rights Council satisfactorily resolved than a new battle has erupted.
The United States is pressing for administrative reforms and threatening to cut off funding if the reforms are not forthcoming.
The Secretary General has submitted a reasonable reform plan, but a majority of UN member states, acting together as the so-called G-77, are balking, because they regard it as another step in reducing the authority of the General Assembly relative to the Security Council.
In particular, they object to the plan’s proposal to give increased powers and responsibilities to the Secretary General, whose selection is effectively in the hands of the Security Council’s five permanent members, which wield veto power.
Many UN members, believing that power within the UN has been shifting from the General Assembly, resist giving up what they regard as its last vestige: control over the budget through the work of the Assembly’s Fifth Committee.
In practice, the Fifth Committee has exercised the kind of micro-management over personnel and expenditure that ought to be exercised by the Secretary General if the UN is to operate effectively and to have a staff which is up to the challenges facing the organization.
This is the basis of America’s insistence on administrative reforms.
There is an urgent need to find a way out of this impasse.
Failure of the current proposal would mean an effective end to all efforts to reform the UN, with disastrous consequences for people across the world who depend on the aid provided by the UN Development Program, the security provided by the UN’s numerous peacekeeping operations, or the myriad other services rendered by UN agencies.
For example, failure of management reform would fuel demands by the US Congress to withhold America’s contributions to the UN budget – a policy that would greatly undermine America’s own interests, such as the planned expansion of the mission to stop genocide in Darfur.
The path to a satisfactory resolution is clear: give the General Assembly a greater role in the selection of the Secretary General so that members would be delegating powers to an authority of their own choosing.
This solution would not only permit the much-needed administrative reforms to be implemented; it would also bring clarity and transparency to a process that is in great need of improvement.
After all, the UN Charter provides that “the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.”
The original concept was that the two bodies would reach a consensus on a candidate.
In practice, however, the five permanent members now agree on a candidate, and their decision is rubber-stamped first by the Security Council and then by the General Assembly.
Real discussions about a new Secretary General are currently being conducted in secrecy among the permanent five, adding to the frustration of other UN members, including large powers that have been seeking without success to enlarge the Security Council.
To achieve the reforms of the budget process that it wants, the US will need to lead the way in persuading the other permanent members of the Council to give the General Assembly a greater role in the process.
This might be done in several ways.
The Security Council might agree to recommend several candidates from which the General Assembly would select one.
Alternatively, the General Assembly might propose several candidates to the Security Council, from which the Council would choose one to refer back to the Assembly for approval.
Either way, the selection process would benefit from greater transparency.
For example, the General Assembly should hold public hearings in which candidates are interviewed, thereby greatly enhancing the stature of the candidate who is eventually selected.
Such proposals, if accepted, would help resolve the current dispute to everyone’s satisfaction.
Indeed, they could make the UN stronger than it has ever been.
PRINCETON – The chaotic and costly international response to the world’s current financial disorder has prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and German President Horst Köhler, a former head of the International Monetary Fund, to call for a new Bretton Woods Conference in order to design a new global financial system.
But such a demand depends on a clear understanding of what a new agreement might provide.
It is easy to see the appeal of scrapping today’s global financial architecture, because there is obviously much that is broken.
The existing institutions were looking increasingly irrelevant in normal times, and ineffective in times of crisis.
Although the IMF delivered some gloomily accurate figures about the likely cost of the US housing fiasco, it played almost no role in addressing the current crisis.
This was the first international financial crisis since the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 in which the Fund stood on the sidelines.
The major international actor, instead, has been the G-7, a grouping dominated by medium-sized European states in which Asia’s dynamic emerging economies – the current source of global savings – have no representation.
The Bretton Woods conference succeeded not because it assembled every state, or because the participants engaged in an extensive powwow.
John Maynard Keynes, an architect of Bretton Woods, believed that the true lesson of the failures of the Depression-era 1930’s lay precisely in the character of the large and chaotic 1933 London World Economic Conference.
Keynes concluded that a really workable plan could be devised only at the insistence of “a single power or like-minded group of powers.”
Keynes was basically right, but he should have added that it helps when one power can negotiate with one other power.
In the past, the most effective financial diplomacy occurred bilaterally, between two powerful states that stood for different approaches to the international economy.
This was true of the preparations for the Bretton Woods meeting.
Although there were 44 participating countries, only two really mattered, the United Kingdom and, above all, the United States.
The agreement was shaped by Anglo-American dialogue, with occasional mediation from France and Canada.
Bilateral talks subsequently remained the key to every major success of large-scale financial diplomacy.
In the early 1970’s, when the fixed exchange-rate regime came to an end, the IMF seemed to have outlived its function.
Its Articles of Agreement were renegotiated by the US, which was looking for more flexibility, and France, which wanted something of the solidity and predictability of the old gold standard.
Later in the 1970’s, European monetary relations were hopeless when France, Germany, and Britain tried to talk about them, but were straightened out when only France and Germany took part.
In the mid-1980’s, when wild exchange-rate swings produced calls for new trade protection measures, the US and Japan found a solution that involved exchange-rate stabilization.
So, what form should such bilateralism take today?
In terms of countries, the obvious new pair comprises the US, the world’s largest debtor, and China, its greatest saver.
In terms of themes, the conference would have to solve a new type of problem: how states should deal with the large flows of capital that over the past four decades have been mediated by the private sector.
Two alternative models seemed to work until 2008.
On one side was the American model, with a variety of regulated banks, lightly regulated investment banks, and largely unregulated hedge funds managing the capital flows.
On the other side was the Chinese solution, with increasingly costly reserve management giving way to activist sovereign wealth funds looking for strategic participation in investments abroad.
Both approaches were flawed – and liable to produce political controversy.
The American model failed because banks proved to be highly vulnerable to panic once it became clear that sophisticated new financial instruments had formed a haystack spiked with sharp, dangerous, and indigestible losses.
And, inevitably, today’s big bailouts have been followed by a politically fraught discussion of which banks were rescued, and whose political interests were served.
Already, there is a ferocious debate about the influence of Goldman Sachs on the US Treasury.
Likewise, the very large European bailouts (totaling as much as 20% of GDP in Germany) have produced controversies about the distribution of costs.
Meanwhile, the Chinese solution gave rise to nationalist fears that sovereign wealth funds might be abused to seize strategically vital businesses or whole sectors of an economy.
The original inspiration behind the creation of the IMF was that a largely automatic and rule-governed body would be a less politicized way of stabilizing markets and expectations.
That remains true today: managing temporary stakes in banks in need of recapitalization, on behalf of large providers of capital (such as the Asian surplus countries), would put a neutral, depoliticized buffer between states and private-sector institutions.
The IMF was originally conceived in 1944 in a world without major private capital flows, one in which states undertook almost all international transactions.
Extending its mission to include some private-sector rescues would recognize the preponderant role that markets now play.
At the same time, the involvement of a rule-bound international agency would minimize the political poison associated with bank recapitalizations and currency interventions.
NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY – As the crisis in Sudan’s Darfur region worsens and negotiaitions to end it drag on, an international consensus is emerging around a “muscular” policy based on public denunciation, severe economic sanctions, and, increasingly, threats of military force.
But none of these steps, taken alone or together, can bring about the ends that their often well-intentioned advocates seek.
On the contrary, they risk reproducing the havoc that such measures have unleashed in Iraq and elsewhere in recent years.
In the United States, cautionary voices have been notably absent even among staunchly liberal newspapers like The New York Times .
Foreign policy advisers to the Democratic Party and neo-conservatives alike have called for “action” against Sudan – demands that have been echoed by an international group of intellectuals and celebrities ranging from Umberto Eco, Jürgen Habermas, and Harold Pinter to Bob Geldof, George Clooney, Mia Farrow, Matt Damon, Mick Jagger, and J.K. Rowling.
Meanwhile, French troops, with the support of other European Union members – notably Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Poland, Romania, and Sweden – are now deployed for putatively humanitarian reasons in the Central African Republic and Chad, where they have already clashed with Sudanese government forces.
The International Crisis Group, Human Rights Watch, and many other organizations support this deployment, while Save Darfur, despite describing itself as a non-political “alliance of more than 180 faith-based, advocacy, and humanitarian organizations,” has, in fact, been pivotal in setting the policy agenda.
This agenda’s interventionism is incremental: tougher economic sanctions, demands that China exercise its influence, creation of a “no-fly zone,” and military force against the Sudanese army.
The assumption is that only real pressure will finally force Sudan’s government to embrace the United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force, negotiate with the West, disband the feared Janjaweed militia, allow refugees from the country’s brutal civil war to return to their villages, and make peace with Southern rebels.
But realizing these aims requires cooperation from the government in Khartoum, whereas each of the proposed measures would only heighten tensions or prove useless.
Existing Western sanctions, for example, have merely driven the Sudanese regime into the arms of China, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
Indeed, investment in Sudan has actually grown $2.8 billion over the last year.
Efforts to “pressure” the Chinese appear similarly futile.
Darfur is hardly a high priority for China, which accounts for 20% of African trade, and buys 60% of Sudan’s oil.
Growing talk – both in Europe and America – about boycotting the Olympics (or the opening ceremony) has proven utterly ineffective in influencing China’s behavior in Tibet.
Would the threat of a boycott really prove more successful vis-à-vis Darfur?
Likewise, even proponents of a no-fly zone are doubtful about its potential efficacy.
After all, Sudan is the size of Western Europe, and Darfur is the size of France, with 158 refugee camps.
Strategic constraints would almost certainly overwhelm enforcement.
Finally, there is the “military option,” which would merely justify fears in Sudan of Western “imperialism.”
Worse, given the splintering of rebel forces in the South, where an estimated 80 tribes and clans control their own militias, a military response could generate a power vacuum in Sudan and destabilize the nine countries – many of them fragile or failed states – on its borders.
Western analysts and activists should have learned by now that and military threats produce only resistance, and that genuine diplomacy involves using carrots as well as sticks.
Yet the emerging policy consensus contains no positive incentives to resolve the Darfur crisis.
Nor is it clear whether its aim is to pressure Sudan into changing its policy or to bring about wholesale regime change.
I have been to Sudan twice, and, as part of a delegation organized by Conscience International, I also visited the refugee camps in Nyala and El Fasher in Darfur.
I have met with dozens of Sudanese politicians and diplomats, and I know that the regime in Khartoum is authoritarian, self-interested, and ruthless.
But it is not monolithic.
Factions within the regime might prove supportive of new policies aimed at tempering the climate of violence in Sudan, decreasing its trade dependency on China, improving conditions for refugees, and lowering international tensions.
Such policies might include:
Normalizing diplomatic relations in exchange for removing obstacles to the deployment of UN-AU forces in Darfur.
Replacing sanctions on Sudan with new investment opportunities and gradually forgiving its foreign debt in exchange for achievement of benchmarks tied to repatriating refugees, rebuilding villages, and demobilizing the Janjaweed ; Calling on not only the government, but also the rebel forces, over which the West has some influence, to bargain in good faith; Engaging China’s desire for international prestige by encouraging it to assume a public role in designing and overseeing repatriation, demobilization, and vocational programs; Offering aid to the Sudanese in rebuilding the tribal reconciliation councils that were destroyed during the civil war; Reintegrating Sudan into the international community through academic exchanges, conferences, political visits, and the like; Strengthening the AU, which Western analysts have consistently underestimated with almost indescribable arrogance, in order to foster African solutions to African problems. The emerging policy consensus toward Sudan is predicated on an approach that has already undermined respect for Western values throughout the non-Western world.
Its interventionist measures won’t work.
They are unrealistic and, ultimately, counterproductive.
There is no time to lose in trying something new.
A remarkable incident has emboldened Chinese journalists.
Earlier this year, the government suspended publication of the newspaperBing Dian Weekly, provoking unprecedented open protest, which received extensive media coverage worldwide.
Even more surprisingly, the government, under the pressure of public opinion, has allowedBing Dianto resume publication.
The editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief were sacked, but the open questioning of the legitimacy of the government’s authority to regulate journalism is bound to have a profound impact.
Foreign observers are prone to associate theBing Dianincident with other recent crackdowns on China’s mass media, and to conclude that Chinese journalism freedom is hopeless under the present autocratic regulation.
Undeniably, there has been no significant change in the government’s system of journalism’s regulation since China adopted its “open door” policy almost 30 years ago.
On the contrary, it has become more rigorous and covert.
But I still have faith that subtle changes are occurring.
A prerequisite of effective control of the media is that the controlled accept the controller’s ideology.
After 1949, the Communist Party cultivated a stable of “theoretical experts” and other ideological servants to write lengthy articles propagating “Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.”
But nowadays, such writers are hard to find, and their work is received by readers with mockery and sarcasm.
In fact, the Central Propaganda Department’s ideological control can be maintained only through internal notices and telephone calls, which are widely scorned.
More importantly, even the regulators themselves have ceased to believe in obsolete and rigid doctrines.
I recently met an official working for a provincial Department of Propaganda and was impressed by his bold and straightforward comments on current affairs.
In private conversation, one might even take him for a liberal – one of a new breed of young and well-educated propaganda officials with an increasingly higher threshold of political sensitivity.
For their part, producers of news have long since ceased to believe that news is propaganda.
I started my career with China Youth Dailyin 1979 and have experienced the whole process of China’s opening up and reformation.
Our generation of Chinese journalists broke from traditional Communist ideas about journalism by the mid-1980’s through extensive reading of Western journalism.
Younger journalists have thus been exposed to Western journalistic ideas from the very beginning.
Indeed, Western works are taught as “models for writing” to journalism students in China’s universities.
This is a crucial change, and it is the fundamental reason for an increasing number of genuine news items and commentaries in China’s media today.
Market pressure has also been important in pushing Chinese media to embrace change.
Contrary to foreign perceptions, only a handful of Chinese media – for example,People’s Daily, Guang Ming Daily, and theEconomic Daily – still live on government funds.China Central Television relies mainly on its advertising income, with only a symbolic fraction of its massive budget covered by the government.
Whether most media outlet can survive is thus solely dependent on their market success.
To be sure, political information remains rigorously controlled, which puts a premium on “harmless” recreational, entertainment, and sports information – the reporting of which is basically free.
This has resulted, in the short run, in an embrace of low journalistic standards.
But many metropolitan newspapers that once thrived on infotainment have seen their circulation fall in recent years.
Sooner or later, readers will start to buy newspapers that can truly inform them and give voice to their opinions.
In fact, it is these tabloids, responding to market pressure, that have started to take on responsibility as public watchdogs.
On many occasions in recent years, they have been the first to break sensitive news.
As a result, mainstream media are being marginalized, and the previously marginalized media are becoming mainstream.
Thus, even without any change in the current system of regulation, extensive coverage of disasters, judicial abuses, and citizens’ pursuit of their statutory rights, along with the questioning of policies from public perspectives, is now common.
For example, reporting by theSouth Metropolitan Daily led to the abolition of an outdated housing ordinance issued by the State Council.Cai Jing magazine’s continuous reporting on SARS enabled the Chinese public to learn the truth about this epidemic.
TheBing DianWeekly ofChina Youth Dailypublished an article by Taiwanese writer Long Yingtai on Taiwan’s democratic development.
Such progress is slow and full of frustrations, for it reflects the incremental evolution of the system.
But it is nonetheless real progress, indicating the growing influence of the Chinese media and pointing to China’s becoming a country of “free expression”.
According to an old Chinese saying, “a just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds scant support.”
A “just cause” resides in people’s hearts.
Without the hearts of news producers – or, increasingly, of censors – the seemingly formidable edifice of journalistic regulation will, sooner or later, collapse like the Berlin Wall.
NEW YORK – Many poor, food-importing countries around the world have become desperate in recent months, as global prices of rice, wheat, and maize have doubled.
Hundreds of millions of poor people, who already spend a large share of their daily budget on food, are being pushed to the edge. Food riots are mounting. 
But many poor countries can grow more food themselves, because their farmers are producing far below what is technologically possible.
In some cases, with appropriate government action, they could double or even triple food production in just a few years. 
The idea is basic and well known.
Traditional farming uses few inputs and gets poor yields.
Poor peasants use their own seeds from the preceding season, lack fertilizer, depend on rain rather than irrigation, and have little if any mechanization beyond a traditional hoe.
Their farms are small, perhaps one hectare (2.5 acres) or less.
Under traditional agricultural conditions, the yields of grain – rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, or millet – are usually around one ton per hectare, for one planting season per year.
For a farm family of five or six living on one hectare, this means extreme poverty, and for their country, it means reliance on expensive food imports, including food aid. 
The solution is to increase grain yields to at least two tons – and in some places to three or more tons – per hectare.
If water can be managed through irrigation, this could be combined with multi-cropping (multiple harvests per year) to produce a crop during the dry season.
Higher and more frequent yields mean less poverty in farm families, and lower food prices for cities.
The key to increasing yields is to ensure that even the poorest farmers have access to improved seed varieties (usually “hybrid” seeds created by scientific selection of seed varieties), chemical fertilizers, organic matter to replenish soil nutrients, and, where possible, small-scale irrigation methods, such as a pump to lift water from a nearby well.
There is nothing magic about this combination of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
It is the key to the worldwide increase in food production since the 1960’s.
The problem is that these improved inputs have bypassed the poorest farmers and the poorest countries.
When peasants lack their own saving accounts and collateral, they are unable to borrow from banks to buy seeds, fertilizer, and irrigation.
As a result, they grow food the traditional way, often earning little or nothing from their harvest, because it’s not even enough to keep their families alive.
History has shown that government action is required to help the poorest farmers escape the low-yield poverty trap.
If farmers can be helped to obtain simple technologies, income can rise, and they can accumulate bank balances and collateral.
With a bit of temporary help, perhaps lasting around five years, farmers can build up enough wealth to obtain inputs on a market basis, either through direct purchases from savings or through bank loans.
Around the world, government-run agricultural banks in poor countries once not only financed inputs, but also provided agricultural advice and spread new seed technologies.
Of course, there were abuses, such as the allocation of public credits to richer farmers rather than to needy ones, or the prolonged subsidization of inputs even after farmers became creditworthy.
And in many cases, government agricultural banks went bankrupt.
Still, the financing of inputs played a huge and positive role in helping the poorest farmers to escape poverty and dependency on food aid.
During the debt crisis of the 1980’s and 1990’s, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank forced dozens of poor food-importing countries to dismantle these state systems.
Poor farmers were told to fend for themselves, to let “market forces” provide for inputs.
This was a profound mistake: there were no such market forces. 
Poor farmers lost access to fertilizers and improved seed varieties.
They could not obtain bank financing. To its credit, the World Bank recognized this mistake in a scathing internal evaluation of its long-standing agricultural policies last year.
The time has come to reestablish public financing systems that enable small farmers in the poorest countries, notably those farming on two hectares or less, to gain access to needed inputs of high-yield seeds, fertilizer, and small-scale irrigation.
Malawi has done this for the past three seasons, and has doubled its food production as a result.
Other low-income countries should follow suit.
Importantly, the World Bank, under its new president, Robert Zoellick, has now stepped forward to help finance this new approach.
If the Bank provides grants to poor countries to help small peasant farmers gain access to improved inputs, then it will be possible for those countries to increase their food production in a short period of time.
Donor governments, including the oil-rich countries of the Middle East, should help finance the World Bank’s new efforts.
The world should set as a practical goal of doubling grain yields in low-income Africa and similar regions (such as Haiti) during the next five years. That’s achievable if the World Bank, donor governments, and poor countries direct their attention to the urgent needs of the world’s poorest farmers.
As former members of our countries' congresses we believe that it is time to create a North American Parliamentary Union (NAPU) to address the growing number of big issues that North America's national governments have pushed to the sidelines.
Both past and present have been burdened by thead hoc nature of relations among the United States, Mexico, and Canada.
A fairer, more prosperous future for all three countries demands that we take a bold step forward.
Despite US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's snide reference to ``Old Europe,'' North Americans can learn much from the European Union and European Parliament.
In the 1950's, most of Europe considered the idea of a Union with a single Parliament a pipe dream.
Today the EU elects its Parliament, shares a single currency, and controls a budget that emphasizes raising living standards within the less developed member countries.
Within the near future, the EU is likely to be 450 million people strong.
The combined population of the US, Mexico, and Canada is about 410 million people. Yet North America has failed to match Europe in building the political structures necessary to focus the hemisphere on the problems of immigration, cross border security, labor rights, and environmental degradation; or in facilitating a more united approach to strong economic competition from Europe and Asia.
On the contrary, in the aftermath of the Iraq War, relations between the US and its neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are at their lowest level in years.
Clearly, efforts to deepen North American political and economic integration will be an uphill battle.
In the near future, the US government will be focused on homeland security, Iraq, the slumping domestic economy, and the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.
Canada's government has been more willing to approach North American issues on a bilateral basis than in a tri-national context; furthermore, Canadians are preoccupied with the consequences and aftermath of SARS and mad cow disease, as well as anticipating a new government next year.
Mexico's President Vincente Fox will govern through 2006. But his vision of a North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) encompassing elements of social and political fusion with his North American counterparts was sidetracked by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and by his political rivals' recent successes at the polls.
Notwithstanding this, most Canadians and Mexicans believe that cooperation in North America will proceed regardless of who is in office in Ottawa, Washington, or Mexico City.
Not only are Canada and Mexico the US's first and second largest trading partners, but the three countries maintain a myriad of relationships--in business, tourism, and culture--that do not pass through their embassies or governments.
Good feelings abound.
US citizens register high approval ratings in Canada and Mexico: 90% and 70%, respectively.
In proposing the creation of NAPU, we envision a specific plan to create a larger market by fostering an alliance between the three economies.
In just a single decade, the EU managed to bring poorer, peripheral member states--Greece, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland--from 50% to 90% of the EU average in per capita income, creating a bigger market for companies from wealthier northern countries, and stemming migration from poorer southern economies.
The EU invested upwards of $35 billion a year to assure the success of their Common Market integration.
North America has largely ignored the significance of ``common,'' preferring to focus on ``market.'' This blinded all three countries to the centrality of community.
We have failed to understand that a North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) that achieves its full potential cannot be accomplished on the cheap.
A regional political structure will maintain the focus on vital but difficult issues such as immigration.
NAFTA was conceived under the assumption that expanded trade would trickle down benefits to all in the three countries.
Regretfully, this corporate-driven NAFTA exacerbated the disparities and asymmetries between Mexico and its two richer northern neighbors.
Moreover, throughout NAFTA's lifetime income and wealth have been further concentrated within the elite sectors of US and Canadian society.
Immigration illustrates the cost of integration without convergence.
Demand for low-cost Mexican labor by US employers and the 10-1 wage gap between the two countries pushes 350,000 Mexicans to risk their lives every year for better paid jobs north of the border.
Without Mexican manpower, much of the work in the US simply would not get done.
The issue must be addressed, not ignored and criminalized.
NAPU would be the ideal forum in which to address this concern.
Everywhere nowadays, key decisions are made by a self-selected group of elites, often in non-transparent circumstances.
NAPU would allow for wider, more consistent participation in the consideration of issues now ignored in all three countries.
Inter-American issues can no longer be left subject to the whims and convenience of individual leaders.
The people of the US, Canada, and Mexico deserve better.
MOSCOW – When Russian President Dmitri Medvedev delivered his annual address to the Federal Assembly I was struck by the fact that his speech seemed to be meant for an advanced, prosperous country, not the real Russia of today.
Russia will hold a presidential election in 2012.
What happens in 2011 will, in my opinion, be even more important than the election itself.
Indeed, the evolution of Russian society could transform Russian politics, despite those domestic opponents who deny change or those who unqualifiedly classify Russia as “incorrigibly authoritarian.”
But, in order for that to happen, a new agenda for Russia must be developed this year.
A decade ago, defense of Russia’s territorial integrity and restoration of governability topped the list of priorities.
People supported a president, Vladimir Putin, who was devoted to this “stabilization” agenda.
We may debate the means by which it was pursued, and how successfully, but Russia’s “existential” challenges were largely overcome.
But progress on stabilization only highlighted Russia’s unresolved problems, which the global financial crisis exacerbated, but did not cause.
After all, Russia’s resource-based, de-industrializing, expenditure-driven economy is the result of purely domestic choices.
Nor was it the crisis that gave rise to corruption, which affects officialdom at all levels, or that caused Russia to lose its democratic dynamic.
We Russians rode along on oil and gas, forgetting that these resources will not last forever.
But, even with favorable world market conditions, we did not manage to solve the problem of poverty, in which millions of Russians still live.
I am convinced that Russia’s troubles all come down to politics.
We need a democratic, competitive environment, initiative at all levels, an active civil society, and real public control.
Only under such conditions will difficult problems lend themselves to solution.
But, starting in 2005-2006, the authorities implemented measures that made responsiveness to acute problems practically impossible.
The decisions to appoint, rather than elect, regional governors, to introduce party-list voting, to raise the electoral threshold for parties to enter the Duma, and to repeal the minimum-turnout requirement – all accompanied by rampant manipulation of elections and the mass media – created a political system closed to feedback from society.
Not surprisingly, the political elite became self-absorbed and served only its own narrow interests.
This summer, with wildfires raging outside Moscow, the elite’s isolation took on a menacing nature.
But something else happened: society became more demanding, recognizing its own interests and knowing how to express them.
Although the traditions of self-organization in Russian society are neither deep nor strong, real movement in this direction became visible for all to see.
Activists from public movements, journalists, ecologists, businessmen, and ordinary people who had suffered the tyranny and corruption of public officials began to join in.
The authorities have recognized this, at least to some degree.
Medvedev's decision to suspend construction of a highway through the Khimki forest near Moscow in the face of widespread civic protest was important.
For many months, Moscow and federal authorities ignored the highway’s opponents, so Medvedev’s decision was a signal: contempt for the people is inadmissible.
Yet right after that, the bureaucracy tried to turn the public hearings – called to give people and civil institutions a voice in solving such problems – into an empty formality.
So the struggle between democratic and anti-democratic tendencies is becoming acute.
If the anti-democratic tendencies win out, all that we have accomplished in previous years will be jeopardized – including stability itself.
This threat evidently motivated Medvedev to speak out in November: “It is no secret,” Medvedev wrote in his blog, “that, as of a certain period, symptoms of stagnation have begun to appear in our political life, and the threat of turning stability into a factor of stagnation has appeared.”
The president’s statement was unexpected.
Medvedev’s assessment attested to his understanding that Russia’s problems are rooted in its politics – in the degradation of the ruling party, in the absence of a real opposition, and in the lack of respect for the rights of political minorities.
I welcome Medvedev’s emphasis on social concerns and his anti-bureaucratic rhetoric.
But his statements are only a first step toward formulating a new Russian agenda, the first point of which must be a renewal and acceleration of movement toward real and effective democracy.
It is vital that Russians believe that Medvedev’s words reflect his priorities, and that he is prepared to fight for them.
Among these priorities, one of the most important is education.
We have approached the point when the constitutional requirement of universal, free education may become a fiction.
People are asking: How is it that, after World War II, the state had enough money to provide free education, whereas today’s Russian state does not?
Society also demands effective mechanisms for combating corruption, which is turning into a serious political problem, precisely because it has widened the gap between the people and the authorities.
Indeed, today’s elite cannot or will not solve the problem.
Only a serious presidential initiative, supported by civil society and brave new political forces, can do the job.
The new agenda must also include a strong economic component.
Patching up holes in the budget and individual initiatives are not enough to ensure economic renewal.
Russia needs a breakthrough toward an up-to-date, knowledge-based, and ecologically sustainable economy.
Here, I see a direct connection with the problem of education.
I am convinced that Medvedev must become the leader in the process of formulating the new Russian agenda, and he must act in the coming year.
Society will support him.
For a few hundred years, when science and mathematics were enjoying a period of great invention, one region of the world stood out.
Masters of these disciplines were revered there, medicine advanced quickly, and the average person was curious about how nature worked.
Not surprisingly, this region was globally respected.
In the other half of the known planet, scientists were punished, even killed.
Mathematics was outlawed as irreligious and alien, and was later made subservient to religion.
The standard of living was low.
The prosperous region was the Islamic Middle East, while an ignorant Europe remained poor.
Both regions were religiously governed (historians differ about the role and natures of the religions in this context), but science flourished only in one of them.
Now, of course the roles of the Islamic Middle East and the West are reversed.
Since World War II, the United States has been the world’s undisputed leader in science.
Throughout this period, the brightest students were drawn away from their native lands, attracted by superior research universities and opportunities.
Until recently, more than half of all mathematics, science, and engineering graduate students in the US were foreign-born.
Many of these talents stayed after graduation, and both industry and government took advantage of this.
Meanwhile, Islamic cultures entered a historical phase in which science was equated with Western influence and eschewed.
Even in countries where oil revenues could fuel a significant amount of research, Arab rulers did not encourage such investment, with the result that their societies have not prospered as much as they might have.
Recently, a desire for greater political respect has spurred Islamic nations to invest in technology, which is most visible in Pakistani and Iranian nuclear ambitions.
But while such weapons carry political weight, the science behind them is mundane and old.
More meaningful is the respect that comes from incubating insights, rather than the products of past discoveries.
Imagine the influence that would be generated by a Pakistani institute that was the world leader in cancer research.
Would the political rhetoric shift if researchers in Oman discovered a key to suppressing AIDS?
This is one unclaimed opportunity.
But another exists, and not just for Islamic societies.
The US has made profound missteps recently.
“Matters of faith” have been substituted for science across government, from the president down.
Top researchers have had their reports changed by political operatives when the facts contradicted official belief.
Encouraged by a religiously influenced administration, school systems are shifting their focus from science to “values.”
Since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, entry visas are fewer and more difficult to obtain, stanching the flow of young talent into US universities.
Major scientific organizations have protested, without result.
At the same time, tax laws have been revised to make investors wealthier in the near term, discouraging long-term investment in research.
Half a trillion dollars was committed to the war in Iraq, an amount roughly equal to the sponsorship of all basic research for the last thousand years.
Even if the US avoids a fundamentalist dark age, it clearly risks losing its global research dominance.
Japan recognized the link between political clout and science in the 1980’s.
Japan’s chief industrialist, Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony, and the right-wing politician Shintaro Ishihara gave a series of speeches that were collected and published in 1986 as a book calledTheJapan that Can Say No.
They outlined a national strategy in which world influence was understood to flow from scientific leadership.
The key idea was that military power could be made obsolete if the “food chain” of military technologies was controlled by other nations.
The book’s title refers to Japan’s plan to “say no” to US military influence once Japan controlled key military technologies.
Building a knowledge-based economy using oil wealth is clearly possible.
For example, Texas, like most southern US states, was once economically poor and declining.
Although it had oil revenue, the flow of dollars into an economy, by itself, does not boost prosperity as much as one might think.
So Texas decided to devote its oil money to an educational endowment.
Today, that endowment is roughly equal to that of Harvard University and spread over 15 universities.
The effect has been staggering: aerospace manufacturing has almost disappeared from California, but is booming in Texas.
Telecom research centers and consortia have flocked to Texas, even from the Canadian telecommunications giant Nortel.
Although manufacturing in the US is in crisis, Texas has one of the strongest manufacturing economies in the world.
There is no reason that the same outcome could not be achieved in the Middle East.
First, however, the Islamic world must rediscover and embrace its proud heritage.
LONDON &#45;&#45; The recent meeting in the Vatican of the “Custodian of The Holy Places,” King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Pope Benedict XVI was a seminal event, particularly as it comes at a time when radical Muslims are decrying the role of “crusaders” in Middle East politics.
It was also the clearest sign yet of a rising “Holy Alliance” among the world’s conservative leaders. For the key audience for this meeting of Muslim king and Roman Catholic Pontiff was not their followers, but another conservative leader, President George W. Bush.
The first “Holy Alliance” was a creation of Austria’s Prince Metternich following the Napoleonic wars.
It was an attempt to preserve the peace (and the security of the relatively weak Austrian Empire) through a coalition of victors upholding shared values.
Metternich’s “Holy Alliance” was the one original political idea to emerge from Napoleon’s defeat.
Behind its exalted name lay an innovation of great diplomatic significance: the introduction of an element of calculated moral restraint into international relations.
The vested interests that the Alliance members – Austria, Prussia, and Russia – had in the survival of their domestic institutions led each to seek to avoid conflicts that, in the past, they would have pursued as a matter of course.
Metternich’s system worked through much of the nineteenth century, because it protected a genuine balance of power between countries that shared common values. But what “common values” do King, Pope, and American President share?
That such a meeting took place is a sign that both Pope and King believed that there was something to achieve.
Indeed, Abdullah, who believes himself to be the paramount leader of the Muslim world, is the first Saudi king to initiate a meeting with a leader of the Christian faith.
The two men met, seemingly as equals, not to express the common values of conservatism, but to confirm and promote their authority to uphold traditional values.
Both agreed that reform must be slow, cautious and that it must never undermine established institutions, especially religion and the patriarchal family.
Abdullah sought the meeting because he believes that the world since 2001 has divided the fraternity of conservatives.
Until then, he and Bush shared a common worldview, emphasizing the importance of religion, the traditional family (as both countries understood it), social discipline, and the state’s role in supporting these institutions.
But Bush, following the terrorist attacks of 2001, turned his back on conservatism.  He sought to radically reinvent the Middle East, not only by overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, but also through his strident calls for democratization.
American radicalism, however, resulted in increasing tensions between religious communities in the Middle East, and the rise of radical Iran with its bid for regional hegemony.
Since 2001, Christian minorities have been targeted throughout the region, including even Lebanon’s Maronite Christian community. And in Iraq, Sunni Muslims feel under siege from the country’s majority and now ruling Shia.
Here is where the Holy Alliance concept of moral restraint comes in.
Abdullah, perhaps earlier than most others, understood that some code of restraint was needed if the entire region was not to descend into a war of all against all.
Moreover, Abdullah understands that his wobbly regime will only be able to withstand the radical gales that are now blowing if it can forge the type of stability-seeking alliance that Metternich built.
The King, like Metternich and the Austrian Kaisers, understands de Tocqueville’s dictum that the most dangerous moment for a regime is when it starts to reform.
Having begun, ever so carefully, to politically open his country, the King knows that he needs regional peace and a lowering of Islamic holy rage.
The problem is that Abdullah cannot rely on his domestic conservative allies to give him the time that the Kingdom needs.
The Wahhabi religious establishment, the Saudi state’s hidden co-rulers, could very well obstruct Abdullah’s attempts at regional religious reconciliation.
Members of the religious police remain adamant that the country’s Christian guests must continue to live according to strict Wahhabi rules of behavior.
While the Wahhabis could yet be bribed again with oil money, the sect’s power-hungry judges eagerly await the next beheading, stoning, or lashing in Riyadh’s public square.
Thus, uniting the forces of status quo conservatism, even if some of those conservatives are Christian, is the only viable diplomatic strategy open to Saudi Arabia. For conservative rulers usually fall when they fail to grasp their own vulnerability, especially when the revolutionary challenge is cloaked in conservative garb.
After all, few political systems can defend against those, like Saudi Arabia’s Islamic radicals, who claim that they can preserve the system and its religious values more effectively than the current rulers. 
Only an alliance of conservative leaders and powers (including a retreat by America from diplomatic radicalism), Abdullah believes, can restore some stability to the Middle East.
The award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the United Nations and to its Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is a cause for true celebration everywhere.
But celebrations should never become an excuse for complacency.
Yes, the UN has achieved much under Secretary General Annan's leadership. But the idea of the United Nations as a uniter of nations remains, in many parts of the world and for many of the world's most complex problems, more an ideal still to be achieved than a living reality.
Some of the most powerful nations in the world still do not see fully cooperating with or participating in UN affairs as in their interest.
Beyond states, the world's many NGOs are growing fast and multiplying in their influence, but without formal rules to define their role in the international system.
Their real power, despite Secretary General Annan's efforts to create a dialogue with them, stands outside the UN framework.
Indeed, NGOs often assume tasks for which the current structure of the UN is unsuited or remains far too weak.
To assist them in their tasks, and to assure that the great global issues of the day are addressed in a forum that unites and does not divide, the UN needs to be strengthened in the fields in which NGO's are working so impressively.
Such strengthening can only be achieved by a fundamental reform of the UN's internal structure.
When the UN was founded in 1945, the primary objective was to prevent the outbreak of World War III.
So, at its foundation, only one powerful body was introduced, the Security Council on which the world's great military powers sat.
The agenda of the Security Council was and remains power, and meeting crises, mostly with military means.
Today, however, the real threats to the majority of the world's population stems from dangers almost unknown back then: poverty, hunger, population growth, migration, the environment, and the like.
For the UN to meet these challenges, its very structure must change.
Two new councils, each with comparable power to the Security Council, are needed: a Social Council and an Economic Council.
The IMF, World Bank, and WTO should not only report to, but be dependent upon this new UN reformed structure.
Why are these new bodies needed?
The world cannot do without rules; it cannot move forward against our age's most pressing problems without defined legal rules and the institutions that regulate international law.
Because these institutions do not exist, the UN must now invent them.
Of course some rules, such as rules governing the promulgation of trade sanctions, now exist within, say, the WTO.
These rules, however, are but steps in the right direction: steps toward socially and ecologically sustainable free trade and against protectionism, especially that often practiced by rich countries.
Across the board, more global rules are needed so that global efforts to confront poverty, disease, and mass migration can be made consistent, predictable and most of all effective.
We have the Rome Statute of International Criminal Code; we are heading for an innovative guide to best practice on how civil society organizations can best contribute to the work of the UN; and we now have a large coalition, far beyond NATO, combatting terrorism.
I am grateful that one of the reactions to September 11th was, if I am not mistaken, a somewhat changed attitude within the USA vis-à-vis the UN.
But it is of a paramount importance that these kinds of change, namely, to incorporate real power into the structure of the UN, make more progress.
In dangerous times such as these, the world's peoples need to prove their solidarity.
The large coalition now fighting terrorism is one way to demonstrate this.
But solidarity also must be recognized within the real power structures of the UN.
The Secretary General convocation of a ``Dialogue of Civilizations'' is but a start here.
Far more needs to be done.
The institution of Social and Economic Councils at the UN would mark an enormous step in the right direction.
I have tried to present the ideas outlined here not only to the General Assembly but also to the permanent members of the Security Council.
I have also been invited to present them to the US Senate.
So far, none of those discussions have proved to be very fruitful.
But just as the time is coming when the US will to come see the UN as indispensable, the Security Council and its members will come to see the creation of new bodies within the UN not as rivals, but as the only means for the world's people, in solidarity, to confront the myriad social and economic problems that they face.
NEW YORK – The solution to manmade climate change depends on the transition to electricity production that, unlike burning oil, natural gas, and coal, emits little or no carbon dioxide – the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
Low-carbon electricity can be produced by solar, nuclear, and wind energy, or by coal-burning power plants that capture and store their CO2 emissions.  
The policy problem is simple. Coal is a cheaper and more easily used energy source than the alternatives.
It is cheap because it is plentiful. It is easier to use than wind or solar power because it can produce electricity around the clock, without reliance on weather conditions. 
To save the planet, we need to induce power suppliers to adopt low-carbon energy sources despite coal’s lower price and greater ease of use.
The obvious way is to tax coal, or to require power plants to have permits to use coal, and to set the tax or permit price high enough to induce a shift towards the low-carbon alternatives.
Suppose coal produces electricity at a cost of $0.06 per kilowatt-hour, while solar power costs $0.16/kilowatt-hour.
The tax on coal-based electricity would have to be $0.10/kilowatt-hour.
In that case, consumers would pay $0.16/kilowatt-hour for either coal or solar.
The utilities would then shift to low-carbon solar power.
The switchover, however, would more than double the electricity bill in this example.    
Politicians are loath to impose such a tax, fearing a political backlash.
For years , this has stymied progress in the United States towards a low-carbon economy.
Yet several European countries have successfully introduced the idea of a “feed-in tariff,” which provides the core of a politically acceptable long-term solution.
A feed-in tariff subsidizes the low-carbon energy source rather than taxing the high-carbon energy source.
In our example, the government would pay a subsidy of $0.10/kilowatt-hour to the solar-power plant to make up the difference between the consumer price of $0.06 and the production cost of $0.16.
The consumer price remains unchanged, but the government must somehow pay for the subsidy.
Here is another way.
Suppose that we levy a small tax on existing coal power plants in order to pay for the solar subsidy, and then gradually raise consumers’ electricity bills as more and more solar plants are phased in.
The price charged to consumers would rise gradually from $0.06/kilowatt-hour to the full cost of $0.16/kilowatt-hour, but over a phase-in period of, say, 40 years (the lifespan of the newest of today’s coal plants).
Assume that as of 2010, the entire electricity system is coal-based, and that the electricity price paid by the consumers is $0.06/kilowatt-hour.
By 2014, suppose that 10% of the 40-year transition to solar power has been achieved.
The consumer price is raised 10% of the way from $0.06 to $0.16, thus reaching $0.07/kilowatt-hour. 
The coal tax for 2014 is then set at $0.01/kilowatt-hour, which is just enough to pay the needed solar subsidy of $0.09/kilowatt-hour.
Solar producers fully cover their costs of $0.16/kilowatt-hour, since they sell power to the consumers at $0.07/kilowatt-hour and receive a subsidy of $0.09/kilowatt-hour.
A small coal tax can support a large solar subsidy.
Suppose, further, that by 2030 the transition to a low-carbon economy is halfway completed.
The consumer price for electricity is now set at $0.11, exactly halfway between $0.06 and $0.16.
The coal tax is now raised to $0.05/kilowatt-hour, just enough to cover the solar subsidy of $0.05/kilowatt-hour.
Once again, the solar producers cover their costs exactly, since the subsidy of $0.05/kilowatt-hour closes the gap between the consumer price ($0.11/kilowatt-hour) and the producer cost ($0.16/kilowatt-hour).
Let us presume, finally, that by 2050, all electricity production has made the transition to low-carbon energy sources.
The consumer price finally reaches $0.16/kilowatt-hour, enough to cover the full cost of solar power without a further subsidy.
This approach allows higher consumer electricity prices to be phased in gradually, yet establishes strong, immediate incentives for adopting solar power.
Moreover, the government budget is balanced every year, since the coal tax pays for the solar subsidy.
The actual transformation in the coming years will have one major advantage compared to this illustration.
Today’s solar power plants might cost an extra $0.10/kilowatt-hour compared to coal, but such plants will be much less costly in the future because of improved technology.
Thus, the magnitude of subsidies needed in a decade or two will be lower than they are today.
Energy debates in the US, Australia, and other countries have centered so far on introducing a cumbersome cap-and-trade permit system.
Every major user of fossil fuel would need to buy permits to emit CO2, and those permits would trade in a special marketplace.
The market price of the permits would be equivalent to paying a tax on CO2 emissions. 
Unfortunately, cap-and-trade systems are difficult to manage and don’t give clear signals about the future price of permits.
Europe has adopted such a system, but other parts of the world have repeatedly rejected it.
In fact, Europe’s biggest successes in promoting low-carbon energy have come from its feed-in tariffs, and carbon taxes in some countries, rather than its cap-and-trade system.  
The time has come for the US, China, India, and other major economies to declare how they will foster their own transition to a low-carbon economy.
A small and gradually rising carbon tax that funds a feed-in tariff system could win political support in the US. It could also help to foster consensus among the major coal-based economies, including China and India.  
There really are effective long-term solutions to manmade climate change that are politically acceptable and feasible to implement.
It is time to embrace them.
VIENNA – US President Barack Obama has injected fresh momentum into efforts – stalled for a decade – to bring about nuclear disarmament.
He has committed himself to the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and acknowledges the link between nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament by the nuclear-weapon states.
Obama has pledged to revitalize the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The non-proliferation regime, of which the NPT is the cornerstone, is in disarray.
The main problems are easily identified.
First, the five main nuclear-weapon states have not taken seriously their NPT obligation to work for nuclear disarmament.
Instead, they have insisted that nuclear weapons are essential for their security and continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals.
This naturally robs them of the moral authority to persuade others not to acquire nuclear weapons, which continue to be perceived as a source of power and influence, and an insurance policy against attack.
Second, as we have seen in the case of North Korea, there is nothing to stop countries that sign the Treaty from simply walking out after declaring that “extraordinary events” have jeopardized their supreme interests.
Third, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is supposed to police the non-proliferation system, is shamefully underfunded.
When it comes to determining whether or not a country is conducting a covert nuclear weapons program, IAEA inspectors often have their hands tied, either because they lack the legal authority to gain access to all the locations they consider necessary, or because the IAEA’s analytical laboratories are outdated, or because the Agency does not have adequate access to satellite imagery.
Fourth, export controls have failed to prevent the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, not least due to the sophisticated efforts of clandestine networks like the one run by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan.
Nine countries already have nuclear weapons, and it would be naive to presume that others, particularly in regions of conflict, will not try to get hold of them.
In addition, a number of countries with nuclear energy programs have the capability, if they choose, to manufacture nuclear weapons within a matter of months if their security perceptions change, because they have mastered the critical technology – uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing.
If more countries take this path, it could prove to be the Achilles’ heel of non-proliferation.
Fifth, the international community, spearheaded by the United Nations Security Council, has more often than not been paralyzed in the face of challenges to international security and ineffectual in responding to suspected cases of nuclear proliferation.
These issues will not be resolved overnight.
But there is much that can be done relatively quickly.
The United States and Russia have started negotiations on deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals, which together account for 95% of the world’s 27,000 warheads.
Other key steps include bringing into force the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty; negotiating a verifiable treaty to end production of fissile material for use in weapons; radically improving the physical security of nuclear and radioactive materials, which is vital to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists; and strengthening the IAEA.
Last month, I proposed a key measure to strengthen non-proliferation to the IAEA’s Board of Governors – establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched uranium (LEU) to guarantee supplies to countries that need nuclear fuel for their power reactors.
LEU cannot be used to make weapons.
Some such mechanism will be essential in the coming decades as more and more countries introduce nuclear energy.
My proposal is to create a physical stockpile of LEU at the disposal of the IAEA as a last-resort reserve for countries with nuclear power programs that face a supply disruption for non-commercial reasons.
This would give countries confidence that they can count on reliable supplies of fuel to run their nuclear power plants, and therefore do not need to develop their own uranium-enrichment or plutonium-reprocessing capability.
This could help to avoid a repeat of Iran’s experiences after its 1979 revolution, when contracts for fuel and technology for its planned nuclear power program were not honored.
Thirty years later, some of the consequences are still being felt.
The LEU would be available to countries in need on the basis of non-political and non-discriminatory criteria.
It would be accessible at market prices to all states in compliance with their nuclear safeguards obligations.
No state would be required to give up the right to develop its own fuel cycle.
The money needed to launch an LEU bank is in place, thanks primarily to a non-governmental organization – the Nuclear Threat Initiative – and initial funding from Warren Buffett.
But this can only be a first step.
It should be followed by an agreement that all new enrichment and reprocessing activities will be placed exclusively under multinational control, and that all existing such facilities will be converted from national to multinational control.
This is a bold idea, but bold ideas are needed now more than ever.
The opportunity to put the nuclear fuel cycle under multinational control was missed 60 years ago because of the Cold War.
The spread of nuclear technology and the growing risk of nuclear terrorism make it imperative that we get it right this time.
On August 8, 2008, the world watched with awe the amazing spectacle of the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing.
We saw the electronic unrolling of Chinese scrolls replete with great historic symbols and were mesmerized by dancers creating “harmony,” using their bodies as ink brushes.
2008 martial arts students performed millennia-old moves with mechanical precision, while the flying celestials and the galloping torchbearer created a sense of heavenly abode on earth.
There was another time when China dazzled the world at its doorstep: the Tang dynasty (618-907), often thought of as China’s golden age, when it was truly the “middle kingdom” at the center of the universe.
Its capital, Chang Àn (modern day Xìan) was a world-class city; visitors came from all over the world and were dazzled by its wealth, beauty, and power.
Its emperors used silver from Persia, glass from Europe, precious stones from Central Asia, and gold implements from India.
